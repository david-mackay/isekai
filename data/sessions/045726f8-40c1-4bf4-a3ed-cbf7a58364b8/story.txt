DM: The autumn wind carries the scent of ink and old parchment as you step into Moonspire Academy’s Grand Quadrangle. Towering spires cast long shadows over the cobblestones, where clusters of students—some in heated debate, others sharing whispered secrets—dot the pathways. A chime rings from the central clocktower, marking the hour before evening lectures. You notice a flyer fluttering against a statue’s pedestal: *"Masquerade of the Twin Moons—this Veil Night. All ranks welcome, but masks mandatory."*

A sharp laugh cuts through the murmur. Near the fountain, a group of nobles’ sons—silk sashes draped over their shoulders—are watching a first-year fumble with a stack of books. One of them, a lanky elf with a smirk, flicks a coin toward the boy. “Bet you drop them before you reach the archives,” he drawls. The first-year’s face flushes, but he tightens his grip.

From the opposite direction, a harried professor in ink-stained robes bustles past, muttering about “missing tomes” and “reckless apprentices.” She doesn’t spare you a glance, but the stack of scrolls under her arm threatens to topple at any moment.

Then, a voice—low and amused—comes from behind you: *“New or just lost?”* A half-orc leans against the archway, arms crossed. Her academy blazer is rolled up to the elbows, revealing scars that speak of more than dueling practice. A silver pin, shaped like a broken chain, glints on her lapel. She tilts her head, waiting. The nobles’ laughter rises again, and her jaw tightens almost imperceptibly.
