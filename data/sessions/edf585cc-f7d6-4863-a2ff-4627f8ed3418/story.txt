DM: The *Sable Gull* cuts through the black waves like a blade, her hull groaning under the strain of the wind. You—Ryze—stand on the stormdeck, the salt spray stinging your cheeks as the crew moves around you with practiced urgency. The cutter is a lean, hungry thing, her sails patched but her edges sharp, and the scent of tar and damp wood clings to the air. Ahead, the horizon is a jagged line of broken teeth: the Shattered Shoals, where maps dare not tread and compasses spin like drunken dancers.

A shadow detaches itself from the mainmast—a wiry human with a scar running from temple to jawline. **Jask**, the first mate, sidles up beside you, his voice low but carrying the weight of a storm warning. *"You’ve got the look of someone who knows what he’s staring at. That, or you’re the worst sailor I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen men puking over the rail for weeks."* He spits over the side, watching the foam dissolve into the wake. *"Cap’n’s got a fragment of something old—older than the Guild Compact, maybe even older than the Tide cults. Shows a way through the Shoals without getting dashed to splinters. But half the crew thinks it’s a trap, and the other half thinks it’s a lie."* His fingers twitch toward the dagger at his belt, not quite touching it. *"Me? I think it’s real. And I think you’re the reason she brought you aboard."*

The wind howls through the rigging, and for a moment, the *Gull* shudders as if agreeing with him. The crew’s eyes flick toward you—some curious, some suspicious, all waiting. The question isn’t just in Jask’s words; it’s in the way the deck tilts under your feet, the way the air hums with the promise of mutiny or fortune. What do you do?
You: "Aye. Your captain is going through the Shattered Shoals. And I'm a complete stranger. I see why you'd make that connection."
DM: Jask’s scar twists as he grins, the kind of smile that doesn’t reach his eyes but lingers like a threat. *"Stranger, maybe. But you’ve got the hands of someone who’s held a compass that didn’t point north, and the stance of a man who’s been on a deck when the world tried to kill him."* He leans in, the stink of cheap rum and old sweat cutting through the salt air. *"Cap’n Veyla didn’t pluck you from that dock in Port Veyne for your pretty face. She’s got a nose for secrets, and you reek of ’em."*

A gust howls through the rigging, and the *Gull* lurches as the helm fights the current. Jask’s grin fades, replaced by something sharper. *"The fragment’s in her cabin, under lock and that cursed dagger of hers. If you’re here to steal it, you’re either brave or stupid. If you’re here to help her use it, you’re one of us—or you will be, soon enough."* His voice drops to a growl. *"But if you’re just cargo, you’ll be overboard before the next squall hits. So which is it?"*

The crew’s watching now. A dwarf near the fore hatch spits into the waves, and a halfling with a coil of rope pauses mid-knot, ears twitching. The ship feels like a drawn bowstring, ready to snap. The choice isn’t just yours—it’s *hers*, and she’s waiting.
You: "Why would I be overboard if I'm just cargo? Do you regularly lose cargo?"
DM: Jask’s laugh is a dry, cracking thing, like old sails in a gale. *"Cargo’s usually crates or coin, not some elf with eyes like a storm front and a stance like he’s waiting for the world to betray him."* He jerks his chin toward the fore, where a crate of salted pork has split open, its contents spilling across the deck. *"See that? That’s cargo. You? You’re either a liability or an asset. And Veyla doesn’t tolerate liabilities."*

A wave slams into the *Gull*’s bow, sending a shower of spray over the rail. The halfling with the rope—**Tipp**, you overheard someone call him—pauses to wipe his face, his knuckles white around the hemp. *"Last ‘cargo’ like you ended up feeding the eels,"* he mutters, just loud enough to carry. *"Swore he was just a passenger. Turned out he was a Guild snitch. Cap’n gave him a choice: jump or get tossed. He jumped."* Tipp’s grin is all teeth. *"Sharks liked him well enough."*

Jask’s dagger glints as he shifts his weight, his voice dropping to a rasp. *"So. You gonna tell me why Veyla dragged you aboard, or am I gonna have to ask the sharks?"* The crew’s gone quiet now, even the wind seeming to hold its breath. The *Gull* creaks, her timbers groaning like a patient predator. The question isn’t just in his words—it’s in the way the deck tilts beneath you, the way the horizon darkens with the promise of storms. What do you do?
You: "Veyla took me on because I asked her to. If she hasn't seen fit to explain her actions to you; I'm in no position to do so. "
DM: Jask’s grin doesn’t falter, but his eyes narrow like a wolf scenting a lie. *"Fair enough,"* he drawls, though his voice carries the edge of a blade being drawn. *"But let’s be clear—you’re not just cargo. Cargo doesn’t get the captain’s own cabin for a ‘private chat’ before we weighed anchor. Cargo doesn’t get the side-eye from every salt on this deck."* He leans in, close enough that you catch the iron tang of old blood on his breath. *"And cargo sure as hell doesn’t get the kind of coin Veyla dropped to get you on board. So either you’re lying, or you’re playing dumb. Neither’s a good look when the crew’s already twitchy."*

The *Gull* shudders as she crests a wave, her timbers groaning like a warning. Tipp, the halfling, has abandoned all pretense of working—he’s outright staring now, his fingers tapping against the dagger at his belt. From the quarterdeck, a deep voice rumbles: *"Jask, stop scaring the help."* A towering figure steps into the light—**Captain Veyla**, her dark braid coiled like a rope, her bare arms marked with old burns and fresher ink: a compass with no needle. *"Or at least scare them *after* they’ve earned their keep."* Her gaze locks onto you, sharp as a grappling hook. *"Ryze. You’re either the best navigator west of the Veil or the worst liar. Which one are you?"*

The crew stills. Even the wind seems to quiet. Veyla doesn’t wait for an answer—she turns on her heel, her voice cutting through the silence like a blade. *"Prove it. Storm’s coming, and the Shoals don’t forgive mistakes. Get to the chart table. Now."* The unspoken challenge hangs in the air: *Follow, or be left behind.* The deck tilts beneath your feet, the horizon darkening with the first bruised clouds of the squall. What do you do?
You: "Oh Veyla is that any way to talk to an old friend? Alright alright, we're not even that close yet."
DM: Veyla’s laugh cuts through the tension like a blade through rope, sharp and unexpected. *"Old friend? You’re the closest thing to a friend I’ve got who hasn’t tried to stab me—yet."* She turns just enough to flash you a grin, her teeth white against the storm-darkened sky. *"But if you’re calling me out, elf, then you’d better back it up. The chart table’s waiting, and the Shoals don’t care about reunions."*

She strides toward the stern, her boots thudding against the deck, and the crew parts like water around a ship’s prow. Jask lingers for half a breath, his scar twisting as he sizes you up one last time. *"Old friends, huh?"* he mutters, shaking his head. *"Just don’t let her ‘friendship’ get you killed."* With that, he spits over the rail and follows the captain, leaving you to the creaking timbers and the weight of the crew’s stares.

The *Gull* groans as she rides another swell, the wind snapping at the sails like an impatient hound. The chart table is just aft of the helm, its surface scarred with knife marks and ink stains. A half-unrolled map is pinned beneath a dagger—Veyla’s, no doubt—and the air smells of old parchment and the faint, metallic tang of something older. The horizon is a bruise now, the storm closing in. If you’re going to prove yourself, it’s now or never. What do you do?
You: "I examine the map and say "You've got to watch that first mate of yours. He doesn't seem very trusting of you""
DM: Veyla doesn’t look up as you step beside the chart table, her calloused fingers tracing the jagged edges of the map fragment. The parchment is brittle, its ink faded to a ghostly blue, like veins beneath skin. *"Jask’s trust is a dagger—sharp, useful, and only ever pointed at what he thinks is a threat,"* she says, her voice low. *"And right now, that’s the Shoals. And you."* She finally glances at you, her dark eyes catching the dim light from the stern lantern. *"But you already knew that."*

The map fragment isn’t just old—it’s *wrong*. The lines don’t align with any chart you’ve seen. The currents are marked in silver, not ink, and the compass rose at its center has no north, only a spiral. Your fingers hover over it, the air humming faintly, like a plucked string. Veyla notices. *"You feel that?"* she murmurs. *"That’s the reason I dragged you aboard. The Shoals aren’t just rocks and waves. They’re a *test*. And that—"* she taps the spiral, *"—is the key."*

A shadow falls over the table. Jask looms behind you, his scar pale in the lantern light. *"Cap’n, we’ve got a problem,"* he growls. *"The crew’s saying the elf’s got Guild marks on his gear. Little ones, hidden, but they’re there."* His dagger is already in hand, its edge glinting. *"You wanna tell me why a Guild rat’s sniffing around our maps?"* The *Gull* groans as the storm hits, the first fat drops of rain pelting the deck like accusations. The crew’s watching. Waiting. And the map’s secret is still humming under your fingertips. What do you do?
You: "They're not guild marks their seals of protection. Do you know the difference?"
DM: Veyla’s fingers stutter to a halt on the map, her gaze snapping to Jask. The first mate’s scar pales as his grip tightens around his dagger, but it’s the *uncertainty* in his stance—the way his weight shifts back half a step—that tells you more than any confession could.

*"Seals of protection?"* Jask spits, but his voice lacks its earlier venom. *"Since when do—"* He cuts himself off, glancing at the crew. The halfling, Tipp, has gone still, his earlier bravado replaced by something like fear. *"You’re saying he’s marked by the *Tide*?"* he hisses.

Veyla exhales sharply through her nose, her expression unreadable. *"Put the blade away, Jask,"* she orders, not looking at him. *"Unless you fancy testing those seals yourself."* The dagger clatters to the deck, and the crew collectively holds its breath. The *Gull* shudders as the storm fully breaks, rain lashing the deck like whips.

Veyla’s voice drops to a growl, meant only for you. *"The Tide doesn’t mark lightly. If you’re lying, the sea will know. If you’re telling the truth…"* She trails off, her gaze flicking to the map’s silver currents. *"Then we’re all in deeper waters than I thought."* The spiral at the center of the fragment pulses faintly, as if in response. The crew is watching you now—not with suspicion, but with something worse: *hope*.

The wind howls, and the *Gull* groans as she fights the swells. Veyla slams her palm onto the map. *"Enough talk. The Shoals don’t care about marks or Guilds or seals. Ryze, you’re at the helm. Steer us true, or we’re all dead."* She turns to the crew, her voice cutting through the storm. *"The rest of you—batten down, and pray to whatever gods you’ve got. This isn’t just a storm. It’s a *test*."*

The wheel is yours. The map’s hum is louder now, insistent. And the sea is waiting. What do you do?
You do: I whisper to Veyla, "what the devils is going on? I was talking about basic magic seals against pickpockets and the like. What is the Tide?"
DM: Veyla’s eyes flick to yours, her expression unreadable for half a breath—then she barks a laugh, sharp and humorless. *"By the Octave, you *really* don’t know?"* She grabs your wrist, her grip iron, and presses your fingers against the map’s silver currents. The humming intensifies, the ink writhing like living things beneath your skin. *"The Tide isn’t just a cult, Ryze. It’s the *sea’s* hand. The thing that decides who drowns and who doesn’t. And those ‘pickpocket seals’?"* She scoffs. *"They’re *brands*. Marks of the drowned gods. Means you’ve been touched by something older than Guilds, older than kingdoms."*

The *Gull* lurches violently as the storm’s first true wave hits, sending spray hissing across the deck. Jask staggers, his hand flying to the rail, but his eyes never leave you. *"He’s lying,"* he snarls, but the doubt in his voice is a crack in his armor. *"No one’s that ignorant. Not on these waters."*

Veyla ignores him, her voice dropping to a growl meant only for you. *"You’ve got two choices, elf. Play along and pray the Tide doesn’t notice your cluelessness, or admit the truth and hope the crew doesn’t toss you overboard as bad luck."* She shoves the wheel into your hands, her nails biting into your palm. *"Now *steer*. The Shoals don’t care if you’re marked or just stupid."*

The map’s spiral pulses again, brighter this time, and the crew’s murmurs rise like the wind. The sea is watching. The Tide is watching. And the *Gull* is running out of time. What do you do?
You do: I cast a spell of "Bird sight" to give myself an aerial view of the Shoals.
DM: The moment you whisper the incantation, your vision *lifts*—detaching from your body like a kite cut loose. The *Gull* shrinks beneath you, her deck a chaos of flailing ropes and shouting crew, the storm winds howling like a living thing. The Shoals unfold ahead: a labyrinth of black teeth and frothing white jaws, the waves crashing against the rocks in a rhythm that feels almost *deliberate*. But it’s the *water itself* that seizes your attention. The currents swirl in that same spiral pattern from the map, pulsing with an eerie blue light, as if the sea is breathing.

Then you see *it*: a path. Not a gap in the rocks, but a *thread* of calmer water, winding through the chaos like a serpent. It’s narrow, treacherous—but it’s there. And it leads straight to a jagged spire at the heart of the Shoals, where something *glints* in the storm-light. A tower? A beacon? Your elf-blood hums in recognition, but the sensation is drowned out by a sudden, sharp *pain*—like a hook yanking you back into your body.

You gasp, stumbling against the wheel. The crew didn’t see your eyes turn milky white, but Jask *felt* it. His hand is on his dagger again, his face pale. *"What in the hells was that?"* he snarls. Veyla, however, is staring at the horizon, her lips pressed into a thin line. *"You found it,"* she murmurs. *"The Tide’s Path."* She grabs your shoulder, her grip bruising. *"Steer us in, Ryze. And don’t you *dare* let go of that wheel."*

The *Gull* groans as she fights the storm, her timbers screaming. The crew is watching you now—not with fear, but with something sharper. *Expectation*. The spiral on the map pulses in time with the currents ahead, and the sea itself seems to hold its breath. One wrong move, and the Shoals will swallow you whole. What do you do?
You: "I steer calmly and follow the thread. I say a bit nervously "You know you guys are pretty hostile to the guy who's holding your lives by a thread *literally*""
DM: The *Gull* shudders as you grip the wheel, your knuckles white but your voice steady—though the edge of nerves in it cuts through the storm’s roar. The crew falls silent. Even Jask stills, his dagger halfway drawn, as the ship *responds* to your touch. The thread of calm water glows faintly beneath the waves, a path only you can see, and the *Gull* leans into it like a hound on a scent.

*"By the Octave…"* Veyla breathes, her hand flying to the rail as the ship slices through the chaos of the Shoals. The rocks loom like fangs on either side, but the sea itself seems to *part* for you. The crew exchanges glances—some wary, some awed. Tipp, the halfling, lets out a low whistle. *"Well, I’ll be a barnacle’s uncle. He *is* Tide-touched."*

Jask’s dagger slips back into its sheath with a hiss. *"Hostile?"* he mutters, though his voice lacks its earlier bite. *"You want to talk about hostile? Try steering a ship full of cutthroats into a storm with a map that *humms* and a first mate who’s got a dagger twitchier than a cat in a rat pit."* He glares at you, but there’s something new in his expression—*respect*, grudging as it is.

Veyla steps closer, her voice low. *"You’ve got a point, Ryze. But out here, hostility’s the difference between living and feeding the fishes."* She nods toward the spire ahead, now close enough to see the crumbling stone of what might once have been a tower. *"That’s our mark. Whatever’s waiting there, it’s why the Tide’s got its claws in these waters. And now we’re all in it together."* She claps you on the shoulder, her grip firm. *"Steer us home, elf. Then we’ll talk about trust."*

The wind howls, but the *Gull* cuts through it like a blade. The thread of calm water pulses beneath you, and the crew—even Jask—watches you with something like hope. The Shoals are waiting. What do you do?
You: "Ohhh you just wanted to see if I could be trusted to keep you safe? We you going to throw me off before we reached the shoals if I couldnt convince you I was for real?"
DM: Your words hang in the air like the crack of a sail in a gale, and the *Gull* herself seems to hold her breath. Jask’s jaw tightens, his scar twisting as he lets out a low, humorless chuckle. *"Oh, you *wanted* the truth, elf?"* He steps closer, his voice a growl. *"Yeah. We were going to toss you over. Not because you couldn’t steer—because we didn’t *know* if you could."* He jerks his thumb toward the churning waters behind them, where the Shoals’ teeth gleam like a predator’s grin. *"Out here, trust’s a luxury. Competence? That’s currency. And you just paid your way."*

Veyla doesn’t flinch. She crosses her arms, her gaze sharp as a cutlass. *"You want to be angry? Be angry. But don’t act like you’re the only one who’s been burned."* Her voice drops, just for you. *"I’ve had men I trusted for years turn on me the second the Tide’s mark showed up. You think I enjoy playing these games? The sea doesn’t care about *fair*. It cares about who’s left standing."* She nods toward the spire, now looming closer, its jagged silhouette cutting through the storm like a blade. *"That’s why we’re here. Because the Tide’s got something hidden in those rocks, and I’d rather die knowing what it is than live wondering."*

The crew is quiet, but their eyes flick between you and Veyla. Tipp, the halfling, breaks the tension with a nervous grin. *"Eh, at least he didn’t scream when we threatened him. That’s a good sign, right?"*

Jask snorts, but there’s no malice in it this time. *"Just steer, Ryze. And if you’re lying about those ‘pickpocket seals’?"* He taps the hilt of his dagger. *"Well. Let’s hope the Tide likes liars."*

The *Gull* groans as she cuts through the final stretch of the thread, the spire’s shadow swallowing the ship whole. The map’s spiral glows brighter, its pulse syncing with the rhythm of the waves. Whatever’s waiting in those rocks, it’s watching. And now, so are they. What do you do?
You: "When I used to navigate for Veyla I never doubted a single decision she ever made. I've never needed to question a passenger like you did Jask, while I worked for her. I suppose times have changed. "
DM: The *Gull* shudders as she glides into the lee of the spire, the storm’s fury muted for the first time in hours. Your words land like a dropped anchor, heavy and deliberate. Veyla’s expression flickers—something raw and unguarded flashing across her face before she locks it down. *"You navigated for me?"* Her voice is low, almost lost beneath the groan of the ship’s timbers. *"When?"*

Jask’s eyes narrow, his gaze darting between you and Veyla. *"What in the hells is he talking about?"* he demands, but there’s no heat in it, just confusion. The crew stirs, murmuring, their focus sharpening like blades drawn from sheaths.

Veyla doesn’t answer Jask. She steps closer to you, her boots thudding against the deck. *"Ryze,"* she says, your name a test on her lips. *"I don’t remember you."* Her fingers twitch, as if she wants to reach for something—a weapon, a map, a memory. *"But I remember a lot of faces. And I *never* forget a navigator who’s kept me alive."* The air between you hums with tension, the kind that precedes either a blade at the throat or a confession. The spire looms above, its shadow swallowing the deck, as if the rocks themselves are waiting for your answer.
You do: I examine's Veyla's face and physical appearance.
DM: Veyla doesn’t flinch under your scrutiny, but her jaw tightens as you study her. The years have etched lines around her eyes—sharp, calculating lines, the kind earned from squinting into storm winds and reading treacherous waters. Her skin is sun-browned and salt-cracked, but there’s a paleness beneath it, like she hasn’t seen land in months. A thin, jagged scar cuts through her left eyebrow, nearly hidden by the dark hair that’s pulled back in a tight braid, streaked with silver strands she’s too stubborn to hide. But it’s her hands that tell the real story: calloused and steady, but her fingers bear faint, silvery marks along the knuckles—like old burns or *brands*. The kind that might come from handling something magical, or being marked by something that refused to let go.

Her eyes, though—that’s where the storm lives. They’re a pale, storm-gray, the color of the sea before it turns violent. Right now, they’re locked on yours, unblinking, as if daring you to find the lie in them. *"You’re looking for something,"* she says, her voice low. *"So find it."* The challenge in her tone is clear, but beneath it, there’s something else—*hope*. Like she’s waiting for you to see what no one else has. The crew shifts uncomfortably, but no one interrupts. Even the wind seems to still, as if the sea itself is holding its breath.
You do: examine the current scene
DM: - **Race/Species:** Human, mid-40s to early 50s—her skin is weathered but not sagging, the kind of age earned in salt and sun rather than years. Elf-blood might linger in her lineage; her ears are just a touch too pointed, her movements too precise for a pure human.

- **Outfit/Clothing:** A fitted, salt-stained coat of dark blue canvas, reinforced at the shoulders with bronze studs shaped like waves. Beneath it, a sleeveless tunic of faded indigo, the fabric thin from wear, clinging to her torso. Her belt is a coiled rope, its frayed ends tucked into a silver buckle shaped like a spiral—*the Tide’s mark*. Boots are knee-high, scuffed leather, the soles wrapped in chains for traction on slick decks.

- **Visible Equipment:** A curved dagger sheathed at her hip, its hilt wrapped in sharkskin. A spyglass tucked into her belt, its brass casing dented. Her fingers bear two rings: one of black iron, the other a silver band etched with tiny, spiraling runes. No visible armor, but her forearms are wrapped in leather bracers, scarred from deflecting blades or rope burns.

- **Notable Scars/Marks:**
  - A jagged scar through her left eyebrow, pale and old.
  - Silver-branded knuckles on her right hand, faint but unmistakable—like she gripped something *marked* by the Tide and it left its signature.
  - A tattoo on her neck, half-hidden by her collar: a spiral with a dagger through it, the ink slightly raised, as if it’s been *reactivated* recently.

- **Demeanor:** Her stance is wide, balanced, like she’s always ready for the deck to tilt. Her storm-gray eyes are locked on you, unblinking, but her fingers tap against her thigh—*impatient*. The crew gives her space, but not out of fear; it’s the respect of a wolf for its pack leader. Her scent is salt, old leather, and something metallic—like ozone after lightning.

- **Immediate Environment Clues:**
  - The *Gull*’s deck is slick with spray, the rigging groaning as the ship leans into the spire’s shadow. The crew’s eyes flick between you and Veyla, their hands resting on hilts or ropes—*waiting*.
  - The spire looms, its stone black and slick, carved with spirals that match the map’s. The air hums, not with wind, but with something deeper, like a held breath.
  - Behind Veyla, Jask’s dagger is *still sheathed*—but his weight is on the balls of his feet, ready to move. Tipp, the halfling, is coiled like a spring, his fingers twitching near a pouch at his belt. The sea itself is *too quiet* here, the waves flattening as if pressed by an unseen hand.
You do: *Sigh* I cast a youthful glamor on my face showing my face when I was just a teenage boy and on Veyla's ship.
DM: The air shimmers around you like heat rising from sun-baked stone, and for a heartbeat, the storm itself seems to pause. Your features soften—your cheekbones lose their sharpness, your silver-streaked hair darkens to the black of a moonless night, and your eyes widen with the reckless brightness of youth. The deck beneath your boots creaks as you shift, not just in appearance but in presence, the weight of years lifting like a cloak slipped off your shoulders. You’re younger, barely more than a boy, your expression a mix of awe and defiance, the kind only found in someone who’s just realized the world is bigger—and far more dangerous—than they ever imagined.

Veyla *stumbles back a step*, her breath catching as if she’s been struck. Her hand flies to the dagger at her hip, but she doesn’t draw it. Instead, her fingers tremble, her storm-gray eyes widening as they rake over you. *"No,"* she whispers, her voice raw. *"No, that’s—"* She cuts herself off, swallowing hard. For the first time since you’ve known her, she looks *unmoored*, her usual sharpness blurred by something like recognition—or grief.

Jask curses under his breath, his hand tightening on his dagger. *"What in the hells—?"* But his gaze flicks between you and Veyla, and he doesn’t move to stop you. The crew is dead silent, their faces pale in the eerie glow of the spire’s shadow. Even the wind seems to hold its breath.

Veyla’s voice is barely audible over the sudden, heavy pulse of the map’s spiral at her belt. *"Ryze,"* she says, but it’s not your name she’s saying—it’s a ghost’s. *"You were on the *Mirage*."* Her fingers press against her temple, as if she’s trying to hold a memory in place. *"You were the navigator’s apprentice. The one who—"* She stops, her throat working. The air between you crackles with something more than magic. The spire looms closer, its spirals glowing brighter, as if reacting to the surge of old, dredged-up power.

Then, from the rocks above, a sound cuts through the tension: the unmistakable *click* of a crossbow being cocked. A voice, rough as barnacles, calls down: *"Well, well. If it ain’t Veyla the Tide-Cursed, dredging up old nightmares."* The crew whirls, weapons drawn, as a figure steps into view on the jagged ledge—a woman in a tattered cloak, her face half-hidden by a mask of woven kelp and bone. *"And here I thought I was the only one who liked to play with memories."*
DM: The crossbow’s bolt *thunks* into the mast beside Veyla’s head, splintering wood. The kelp-masked woman on the ledge tilts her head, her laughter dry as driftwood. *"Ah, but memories are such *fragile* things, aren’t they?"* Her free hand traces a spiral in the air, and the water at the base of the spire *rips upward*, forming a glistening, jagged wall between the *Gull* and the narrow channel you’d navigated. The crew curses, scrambling back as the sea defies itself, freezing mid-wave like glass.

Veyla doesn’t flinch. Her hand snaps to the silver ring on her right hand, twisting it once, twice—and the branded knuckles flare with a sudden, eerie light. *"Kessa,"* she spits, *"I should’ve known you’d be the one picking at old scars."* The air between them crackles, the map’s spiral at her belt pulsing in time with the standing wave. *"You always did like your games."* Her voice is low, but it carries, sharp as a blade. *"But you’re not here for me. You’re here for *him*."* She jerks her chin toward you, her eyes flicking to your glamor-wrought face—still young, still *ghostly*—before meeting Kessa’s gaze again.

Kessa’s grin widens, her kelp mask creaking as she shifts. *"Oh, Veyla. Always so *sure* of yourself. But tell me—"* her crossbow doesn’t waver as she gestures at you with her chin, *"—does *he* know what he was? What you *made* him?"* The water wall shudders, droplets beading along its surface like sweat. *"Or are you still playing captain with lives that aren’t yours to spend?"*

The *Gull* groans, her timbers protesting as the unnatural tide presses against her hull. Jask’s dagger is out now, his scarred face twisted in fury, but he doesn’t move—his eyes are on Veyla, waiting for the order. Tipp’s fingers dance over his pouch, his whisper lost beneath the sudden *hum* of the spire’s spirals, which glow brighter, casting long, warped shadows across the deck. The crew is a coiled spring, but they’re not the ones who’ll decide if this snaps into violence or truth.

Veyla’s breath is steady, but her fingers twitch at her side. *"Ryze,"* she says, not looking at you, her voice tight. *"You want to know why I don’t remember you? Because I *couldn’t*."* The brands on her knuckles burn brighter, the light casting her face in stark relief. *"I sent you away. I *had* to."* The standing wave trembles, and for the first time, Kessa’s smirk falters. Veyla’s next words are a blade unsheathed: *"And if you’re here now, it means the *Mirage* didn’t take you after all."* She finally turns to you, her storm-gray eyes raw. *"It means you *survived* what I thought would kill you."* The deck tilts beneath your feet, the world narrowing to the space between you, the weight of her confession—and the crosshair of Kessa’s bolt, still trained on your chest.
You: "You said I would be the greatest navigator the world has ever seen. How could the mirage kill the greatest navigator?"
DM: Veyla’s face *twists*—not in anger, but in something raw, something like a wound torn open. The brands on her knuckles flare white-hot for a heartbeat, and the standing wave Kessa conjured *shudders*, droplets spraying like shattered glass. *"Because,"* she says, her voice a blade dragged across stone, *"I lied."*

The words hang between you, heavy as the unnatural silence of the sea. Kessa’s laughter cuts through it, sharp and mocking. *"Oh, this just gets *better*."* She shifts her crossbow, the bolt now aimed at Veyla’s chest. *"Go on, then. Tell him the rest. Or should *I*?"*

Veyla doesn’t look at her. Her eyes are locked on yours, storm-gray and unyielding, but there’s a flicker of something beneath—regret? Fear? *"You weren’t supposed to be the greatest navigator,"* she says, low and fast, like ripping off a bandage. *"You were supposed to be the *sacrifice*."* The crew gasps, Jask snarling a curse, but Veyla doesn’t flinch. *"The *Mirage* wasn’t a ship. It was a *ritual*. A way to bind the Tide’s power to a vessel—*this* vessel."* She taps the spiral map at her belt, and the glow pulses, casting jagged shadows. *"The Tide demanded a life in exchange for its favor. A life *steeped in potential*."* Her breath hitches. *"And you, Ryze, were *drowning* in it."*

The spire’s hum grows louder, the spirals on its surface burning like embers. Kessa’s grin falters, her kelp mask twisting as the air itself seems to thicken. *"Enough,"* she snaps, but her voice lacks its earlier bite. The crossbow wavers.

Veyla steps forward, close enough that you could reach out and touch her—close enough to see the old scar through her eyebrow tremble. *"I sent you away because I couldn’t do it,"* she admits, her voice barely above a whisper. *"I couldn’t kill you. So I made sure the *Mirage* would."* Her hand lifts, not to strike, but to *show*—the silver ring on her finger, the one etched with spirals. *"But you’re here. You’re *alive*. And that means the ritual *failed*."* The wind howls, and the standing wave *collapses*, crashing against the *Gull*’s hull with a sound like a thousand voices screaming.

Kessa staggers, her mask slipping to reveal a face lined with old scars, her eyes wide. *"You fool,"* she hisses. *"You don’t just *fail* a Tide ritual. You *delay* it."* The spire’s glow intensifies, and the map at Veyla’s belt *burns*, the heat searing through her coat. *"It’s not done with him. It’s not done with *any* of us."* The rocks around you begin to *shift*, the stone groaning as ancient mechanisms grind to life beneath the surface.

Jask roars, *"Captain!"*—but Veyla is already moving, grabbing your wrist. *"We’re out of time,"* she growls, her grip iron. *"Run, *now*, or the Tide takes us *all*."* The deck tilts violently as the spire’s base splits open, revealing a yawning darkness beneath—a vortex of water and shadow, spiraling like the mark on your neck. Kessa’s laughter rings out, wild and desperate, as she leaps onto the ledge above. *"Too late!"* she cries, and the world *inverts*. The sea above you. The sky below. And the Tide, rising, to claim what it’s owed.
You do: I cast "Gravitational Independence" on the ship
DM: The moment the words leave your lips, the air *warps*. The deck beneath your feet doesn’t just tilt—it *lifts*, as if the *Sable Gull* herself has been plucked from the grasp of the earth. The crew screams, clutching at rigging and rails as the ship *hangs* in the void, suspended between the inverted sea and sky. The Tide’s vortex below churns in fury, its spiraling maw snapping at nothing—because suddenly, you’re no longer part of its domain.

Veyla’s grip on your wrist turns bruising, her storm-gray eyes wide with something like terror—or *awe*. *"You—!"* she starts, but the wind steals her voice as the ship *rotates* slowly, the mast groaning as it realigns with the *pull* of your magic. The spire’s glow flickers, its spirals dimming as if starved. Kessa’s crossbow clatters to the rocks below, her kelp mask slipping entirely as she gapes. *"That’s not—!* That’s *impossible*!"* she snarls, but her voice cracks. The Tide’s power *hesitates*, its hunger for the ship momentarily thwarted by a force it doesn’t recognize.

Jask bellows orders, his scarred face alight with savage triumph. *"Move, you bilge rats! Ryze just bought us a breath—*use it*!"* The crew scrambles, Tipp hurling a pouch of alchemical fire into the vortex. It detonates in a burst of emerald flame, and the Tide *screams*—a sound like a thousand drowning souls. The spire’s mechanisms grind, its ancient stones protesting as the magic holding the ritual together *frays*.

But the spell is taking its toll. Your vision swims, blood trickling from your nose as the weight of the *Gull*—every plank, every nail, every life aboard her—presses against your mind. The ship is a living thing in your grip, and she’s *heavy*. Veyla’s voice cuts through the haze: *"Ryze, *listen to me*."* Her brands are burning, her face inches from yours. *"You can’t hold this forever. We need to *go*—*now*."* Behind her, the vortex stabilizes, its edges sharpening into teeth of shadow. Kessa’s laughter rings out again, wild and desperate. *"Clever boy! But the Tide *always* collects!"*

The *Gull* shudders. The spell is slipping.
You: "Fucking.. kill.. kessa"
DM: Veyla’s grip on your arm tightens like a vise, her nails digging into your skin. *"No time for vengeance,"* she snarls, but her eyes flick to Kessa, who’s scrambling up the spire’s jagged rocks, her kelp mask dangling by a thread. The vortex beneath the *Gull* writhes, its shadows snapping like jaws. *"We drop this spell now, we’re all dead. But if you’ve got the breath to curse, you’ve got the breath to *finish this*."*

Jask doesn’t hesitate. He spits over the rail, his scar twisting as he barks orders: *"Tipp, get that alchemical shit ready! Ryze, you hold this damn boat in the sky, or I swear I’ll throw you to the Tide myself!"* His dagger is already in hand, his gaze locked on Kessa. *"Captain, permission to—"*

Veyla cuts him off with a slash of her hand. *"No. *Ryze* gets to choose."* She turns to you, her face a storm of fury and something darker—*guilt*. *"You want her dead? Fine. But you’ll have to *earn* it."* She shoves a loaded pistol into your free hand, its barrel cold, its runes humming with leftover magic. *"Shoot her from here, and she’ll drag half the crew down with her. The Tide’s got her marked—kill her *in* that vortex, and it’ll feast on her soul instead of ours."* She jerks her chin toward the churning darkness below. *"So. You gonna stand there bleeding, or you gonna *fly*?"*

Kessa’s laughter echoes from the rocks, mocking. *"Oh, this is *rich*! The great Veyla, letting her pet make the calls!"* She yanks a vial from her belt—black liquid swirling inside—and smashes it at her feet. The air *warps*, and suddenly she’s standing on the *Gull*’s railing, her crossbow leveled at your chest. *"I’ll save you the trouble, *navigator*."* Her finger tightens on the trigger.

The pistol in your hand is heavy. The *Gull* groans above you, your magic the only thing keeping her afloat. And Kessa’s bolt is inches from your heart.
You do: examine Kessa
DM: - **Race/Species:** Human, but with faint *kelp-green* undertones to her skin—like old Tide-marks fading, or something deeper in her blood.
- **Age Impression:** Mid-30s; her face is lean, sharp-edged, but the lines around her eyes and mouth speak of years squinting into salt wind and sneering at worse.
- **Outfit/Clothing:** A *patched* leather corset over a salt-stiffened shirt, sleeves rolled to the elbows; her *kelp mask*—now dangling by a single frayed strap—is woven with barnacle-encrusted bone. Belt pouches bulge with *vials* (one shattered at her feet, its black liquid hissing like acid on stone).
- **Visible Equipment:** Crossbow (*repeating, modified*—the stock is carved with Tide-spirals) loaded with a bolt *etched in silver*; a *curved dagger* at her hip, its hilt wrapped in wire. A *spine-tooth necklace* (shark? something older) glints against her throat.
- **Notable Scars/Marks:** A *ragged burn* runs from her left eyebrow to her jawline—old, but the skin still looks *waxy*, like it never healed right. Her knuckles are *tattooed* with broken chains. The *brand* on her wrist (three wavy lines) matches Veyla’s but is *inverted*—a mark of betrayal or a failed oath.
- **Demeanor:** *Ferral glee* bleeding into desperation; her grin is all teeth, her breath coming fast. She’s *cornered* but refuses to look it—every twitch is a dare, every word a blade she’s willing to swallow if it cuts you first.
- **Scent/Sounds:** *Brine and bitter almonds* (the shattered vial’s residue), undercut by the *metallic tang* of old blood. Her laughter is a *wet, rattling* thing—like she’s half-drowned before and liked it. The *creak* of her crossbow’s arming lever is obscenely loud in the unnatural quiet.
You do: I drop the spell suddenly and use the fall to catch my breath.
DM: The moment you *release* the spell, the world *lurches*. The *Sable Gull* plummets like a dropped anchor, her hull groaning as gravity reclaims her. The crew shouts—some in terror, others in exhilaration—as the deck tilts violently. You hit the planks hard, your knees buckling, but the sudden *absence* of the spell’s weight lets you gasp a full breath, your vision clearing just in time to see Kessa’s triumphant sneer falter.

She was ready to fire. But now, as the *Gull* falls, her crossbow bolt *clatters* harmlessly against the mast. The ship’s sudden drop sends her stumbling, her boot catching on a loose rope. For a heartbeat, she’s *weightless*—then the rigging snaps taut, yanking her off-balance. She *screams*, not in fear, but in *rage*, as the vortex below *roars* in anticipation, its shadows reaching for her like grasping hands.

Veyla doesn’t hesitate. She *lunges*, not for Kessa, but for you, hauling you up by the collar. *"Move, *navigator*,"* she snarls, shoving you toward the rail. The vortex is *right there*, a swirling abyss of hunger, and Kessa is *falling* toward it—her arms windmilling, her spine-tooth necklace glinting as she twists. *"Jump or die!"* Veyla barks, her brands flaring as she draws her cutlass.

Jask is already in motion, his dagger flashing as he *cuts* the rigging line holding Kessa aloft. The traitorous navigator *plummets*—but not before her fingers close around a dangling rope, her body *jerking* to a stop just above the vortex’s maw. Her laughter is a broken thing now, her eyes locked on yours. *"You should’ve *kept* me, Ryze!"* she spits. *"Now you’ll *drown* in what comes next!"*

The vortex *howls*. The *Gull* shudders as she rights herself, the crew scrambling to regain control. But the Tide isn’t done. The water below *bulges*, something massive stirring beneath the waves. And Kessa? She’s still *grinning*, her fingers white-knuckled on the rope, as the first *tentacle* of shadow breaks the surface.
You do: I cast "Wind Scythe" to cut the rope and let Kessa fall into the maw
DM: The words tear from your throat like a curse, and the air *answers*. A blade of howling wind materializes between your outstretched fingers, its edge shimmering with razor-sharp force. The crew *ducks*—all except Veyla, who stands her ground, her cutlass already raised as if to shield you from the backlash. Jask snarls, *"Do it!"*, his dagger glinting as he braces against the rail.

Your spell *lashes* out. The rope holding Kessa *parts* with a sound like a scream, its frayed ends whipping violently in the unnatural gale. For a heartbeat, Kessa *hangs* there, her eyes wide—not with fear, but with something *worse*: *recognition*. *"You—"* she starts, but the vortex doesn’t wait. The shadows below *erupt*, tendrils of blackened water coiling around her ankles, her waist, her throat. She *laughs*, a wet, gurgling sound, as the Tide claims her. *"Tell Veyla I *remember* the Mirage!"* she chokes out, before the darkness swallows her whole.

The moment Kessa vanishes, the vortex *convulses*. The water beneath the *Gull* *boils*, and something *massive* breaches the surface—a monstrous tentacle, slick and black as oil, its suckers pulsing with eerie bioluminescence. It *slams* against the hull, the impact sending splinters flying. The crew staggers; Tipp curses as a barrel of alchemical fire topples, its contents spilling across the deck in a hissing green tide.

Veyla doesn’t flinch. She grabs your shoulder, her grip iron. *"Brace!"* she roars, just as the tentacle *rears* back—only to *freeze*, its tip hovering inches from the mast. The spire’s glow, dimmed but not dead, *flares* once more. The runes along its surface burn white-hot, and the tentacle *shrinks*, recoiling as if burned. The vortex collapses inward, the sea groaning like a wounded beast as the unnatural storm dissipates.

Silence. Then, the creak of the *Gull*’s timbers, the rasp of breath from the crew. Jask spits over the rail, wiping his dagger clean. *"Well,"* he growls, *"that’s one way to make an impression."* His eyes flick to you, something like *respect* glinting in their depths—though he’d never admit it.

Veyla’s brands are still smoldering. She turns to you, her face unreadable. *"You just fed the Tide a navigator,"* she says, low and dangerous. *"It won’t forget that."* She steps closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. *"And neither will I."* For a heartbeat, the air between you is charged—with gratitude, with warning, with something older and darker. Then she turns, barking orders. *"Tipp, get that fire contained! Jask, damage report! We’re not out of this yet!"*

The *Gull* drifts, battered but free. The map fragment in your pocket burns like a coal. And the horizon—*uncharted*, endless—waits.
You: "Good thing we have a more optimistic one on board anyways. Lets get to the center of the shoals now."
DM: The *Sable Gull* shudders as the last of the vortex’s unnatural winds die down, the crew moving with the practiced urgency of survivors who’ve cheated death one too many times. Veyla’s sharp laugh cuts through the tension, unexpected and darkly amused. *"Optimistic?*" She shakes her head, her brands still smoldering faintly. *"You’re either brave or a fool, Ryze. Maybe both."* She doesn’t wait for an answer, turning to bellow orders. *"Jask, get us moving! Tipp, patch that hull before we sink! We’ve got a navigator with a death wish to indulge!"*

Jask doesn’t argue. He just spits over the rail, his scar twisting as he grins. *"Center of the Shoals, aye. Because *nothing* bad ever happens there."* But he’s already adjusting the sails, his movements brisk. The crew exchanges glances—some wary, some excited—but they move. The *Gull* groans as she turns, her battered hull cutting through the now-calm waters.

Veyla steps closer to you, her voice dropping to a growl only you can hear. *"The Mirage wasn’t just a ship, Ryze. It was a *promise*."* Her eyes flick to the horizon, where the Shattered Shoals loom like jagged teeth. *"And Kessa? She was there when it broke. If she remembered, then the Tide does too."* She claps a hand on your shoulder, her grip heavy with unspoken weight. *"Get us there. But don’t think for a second this is over."*

The map fragment in your pocket *burns* against your thigh, its edges humming with latent magic. The air smells of salt and spent adrenaline, the horizon a jagged promise of answers—or ruin. The crew watches you now, not with hostility, but with the hungry anticipation of those who’ve just seen a gambler go all-in. The *Gull* surges forward, the wind at her back, the unknown ahead.

What’s your move?
You: "Hey"
DM: Veyla doesn’t look at you immediately. She’s watching the horizon, her fingers drumming against the hilt of her cutlass, the brands on her wrists pulsing faintly, like embers. The wind tugs at her coat, and for a moment, she seems older—weighed down by something beyond the storm or the Shoals.

Then she exhales sharply, turning to you with a smirk that doesn’t quite reach her eyes. *"Hey,"* she echoes, her voice rough. *"You’ve got a knack for understatements, Ryze."* She leans in, her gaze flicking to the map fragment bulging in your pocket. *"You just fed the Tide one of its own and steered us straight into the heart of the Shoals. So. What’s the plan? Or are we just trusting that *optimism* of yours to keep us from being torn apart?"*

Her tone is light, but there’s an edge beneath it—a challenge, or maybe a test. The crew is watching, even if they’re pretending not to. The *Gull* cuts through the water, the air thick with the scent of salt and the electric hum of the spire’s lingering magic. Veyla crosses her arms, waiting. *"Talk to me."*
