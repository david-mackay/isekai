DM: The Council Hall’s towering oak doors groan open before you, revealing a chamber alive with tension. Marble floors reflect the flickering torchlight, and banners—some embroidered with the Guild Compact’s golden scales, others with the Wardens’ League’s silver oak—hang motionless in the still air. The scent of beeswax and old parchment clings to the space, thick enough to taste. At the far end, a dais supports a long table where two figures stand locked in debate: a human woman in a high-collared coat of Compact green, and a dwarf with a Warden’s silver circlet, his fingers drumming impatiently on the tabletop.

A guard in Warden’s colors steps aside just enough to let you pass, his voice low: *"They’ve been at it since the grain shortage reports came in. The Compact’s blaming us for the sabotaged envoy. If you’ve got business, now’s the time—before the oath-binding starts."* His eyes flick to the silver bowl at the dais’s foot, where a single drop of blood from each speaker seals their words as unbreakable under the Octave’s justice.

The human woman slams a ledger shut. *"Another shipment lost to ‘bandits’? Convenient. The Wardens’ tolls strangle trade, and now you feign surprise when the roads aren’t safe?"* The dwarf snorts, *"Safe? Your merchants pack false manifests and call *us* thieves. The League doesn’t need to sabotage—your greed does the work."* His gaze cuts to you as you enter, sizing you up. *"Ah. A neutral party. Maybe you’ll talk sense into her."*

The room holds its breath. The choice is yours: step forward to mediate, side with one faction, or linger near the guards for more context. The silver bowl gleams.
DM: The Compact woman’s fingers twitch toward the ledger, but she doesn’t reopen it. Instead, her sharp gaze locks onto you—assessing, calculating. *"A dwarf. Neutral, you say?"* Her voice drips with skepticism. *"No dwarf’s neutral when Warden tolls line their clan’s coffers."* She taps the ledger. *"Three caravans ‘lost’ in two moons. The last carried seed grain for Halfmire’s planting. You think that’s coincidence?"*

The Warden dwarf crosses his arms, his silver circlet catching the light as he shakes his head. *"And you’d have us believe your merchants don’t skim a fifth off every shipment? The Octave’s scales don’t tip for free, sister."* He turns to you, exhaling through his nose like a bull about to charge. *"Look, if you’re here to mediate, fine. But if you’re just another Compact lackey—"* His hand drifts toward the hilt of his belt knife, not drawing it, but making his point clear.

A murmur ripples through the guards along the walls. One, a half-orc with a scarred lip, leans in just enough to mutter, *"They’re two breaths from oath-binding. After that, it’s either blood in the bowl or blades on the road."* She jerks her chin toward the dais. *"You speak now, or you’re just another witness."*

The Compact woman smirks, but there’s an edge to it—desperation, maybe. *"Go on, then. Tell me, neutral party: do you think starvation’s a fair toll?"* She flips the ledger open to a page smudged with what might be soot or dried blood. *"Or shall we ask the Wardens why their ‘protection’ only extends as far as their purse?"*

The air hums with the weight of unspoken threats. The silver bowl waits. The Warden’s knuckles whiten around his knife hilt. The choice isn’t just about words anymore—it’s about what you’re willing to risk to back them up.
You: "Average interaction with a human"
DM: The Compact woman’s smirk falters for half a heartbeat—just long enough to reveal the exhaustion beneath her sharp demeanor. She exhales through her nose, a sound like a laugh without humor, and slaps the ledger shut with enough force to make the guards flinch. *"Oh, by the Octave’s scales, a *dwarf* lecturing *me* on human dealings. How original."* She leans forward, bracing her palms on the table. *"Tell me, Moki—can I call you Moki?—do you even *know* what’s in those caravans? Or do you just see ‘human’ and assume we’re all the same: liars, thieves, or fools?"*

Her voice drops, low and deliberate, as she taps the ledger again. *"That grain wasn’t just *grain*. It was seed stock for Halfmire’s spring planting. No seed, no harvest. No harvest, no rent. No rent?"* She spreads her hands. *"The Wardens’ tolls don’t mean much when the fields are fallow and the people are starving."* Her gaze flicks to the Warden dwarf, then back to you. *"But sure. Let’s talk about ‘average interactions.’ Maybe you’d like to explain to the farmers why their children will go hungry because someone decided their ‘protection’ was more important than their lives."*

The Warden dwarf scoffs, but there’s a tightness around his eyes. *"Spare me the theatrics, Elara. You think *we* want empty roads? Empty roads mean empty coffers. And empty coffers mean the League can’t pay the rangers who *actually* keep the bandits at bay."* He jerks his chin toward the ledger. *"Show her the *rest* of the page, then. The part where your merchants ‘adjust’ the tolls to line their own pockets."*

Elara’s fingers twitch, but she doesn’t open the book. Instead, she turns to you, her voice quieter now, almost pleading. *"You want to know what’s *really* in those caravans? Hope. That’s what’s being stolen. And if you’re here to tell me that’s just ‘average,’ then maybe you’re part of the problem."* She steps back from the table, her posture rigid. *"Go on, then. Side with him. See how well the Wardens’ coin feeds a village."* With that, she turns on her heel and strides toward the chamber’s side door, her guards falling in behind her.

The Warden dwarf watches her go, then sighs, rubbing his temples. *"Octave’s mercy, she’s stubborn."* He looks at you, his expression unreadable. *"You got a better idea, or are we just wasting breath?"* The half-orc guard near you mutters under her breath, *"That’s it. Oath-binding’s next. Unless you’ve got a miracle."* The silver bowl gleams, untouched. The room waits.
You: "Theres something in those caravans she's not telling us about."
DM: The Warden dwarf’s eyebrows shoot up, and he barks a laugh—sharp, humorless. *"Oh, now *that’s* a thought."* His grip on his knife hilt loosens as he leans forward, elbows on the table, suddenly far more interested in you than in Elara’s retreating back. *"You’ve got a nose for lies, Moki. Or just a nose for *her* kind?"* He jerks his chin toward the side door where Elara disappeared, then lowers his voice. *"The Compact’s been moving more than grain. Last month, one of their wagons got hit near Blackroot Pass—not by bandits. By *something* that left claw marks deep enough to split oak planks."* He taps his fingers on the table, a slow, deliberate rhythm. *"You know what does that? Not wolves. Not bears. And sure as hell not human thieves."*

A guard near the door—one of Elara’s, by the Compact green trim on his cloak—shifts uncomfortably. His hand drifts to the pommel of his sword, but he doesn’t draw. *"You’re talking nonsense, Dain. Next you’ll say the Night Veil’s involved."* But his voice lacks conviction.

Dain, the Warden dwarf, snorts. *"Nonsense? Then explain why the Compact’s suddenly so keen on shipping ‘seed grain’ under armed escort. Or why their ledgers smell like alchemist’s brine."* He fixes you with a hard stare. *"You want the truth? Fine. But it’s not just about what’s *in* those caravans. It’s about what’s *following* them."* He straightens, rolling his shoulders like he’s preparing for a fight. *"So. You in, or are you just here to waste my time?"*

The half-orc guard from earlier steps closer, her voice a growl. *"If you’re digging into this, you’d best decide quick. Oath-binding starts at sundown. After that, the only way out of this hall is with a blade or a blood debt."* Outside, the distant clatter of a wagon rolling over cobblestones echoes through the chamber. The sound is too heavy, too hurried—like someone’s making a run for the gates. Dain’s eyes narrow. *"That’s not one of ours."* The choice is yours: press Dain for more details, follow the sound of the wagon, or confront Elara before she leaves. The hall feels smaller, the air thicker. The silver bowl’s gleam is now a warning.
You: "What does it mean to be in? I don't know what oath is being bound."
DM: Dain’s grip tightens on the edge of the table, his knuckles whitening like cracked stone. *"It means,"* he growls, *"you’re not just some bystander watching the Compact and the League tear each other’s throats out over scraps."* He jerks his chin toward the silver bowl at the dais’s foot, where a single drop of blood would seal your words as unbreakable under the Octave’s justice. *"Oath-binding’s not just about promises, Moki. It’s about *consequences*. You swear to uncover the truth about those caravans—what’s in ‘em, what’s hunting ‘em, why Elara’s lying through her teeth—then you’re bound to see it through. Fail, and the Octave’s scales don’t just tip against you. They *crush* you."*

He leans in, his voice dropping to a rough whisper. *"But if you’re in, you get the League’s backing. Our rangers, our roads, our coin if it comes to it. And if we’re right—if there’s something worse than bandits or thieves out there—you won’t be facing it alone."* His eyes flick to the side door where Elara vanished, then back to you. *"She’s not just hiding grain. She’s hiding *fear*. And fear’s a hell of a lot more dangerous than greed."*

The half-orc guard crosses her arms, her scarred lip twisting. *"He’s not wrong. Oath-binding’s no joke. But if you’re thinking of weaseling out, don’t bother. The second that bowl gets a drop of blood, this hall’s locked tighter than a tomb. You’re either part of the solution or part of the problem."* She nods toward the distant clatter of the wagon outside, now fading into the city’s ambient noise. *"That wagon? It’s not waiting for you. Neither’s whatever’s chasing it."*

Dain straightens, rolling his shoulders like he’s bracing for a storm. *"So. You in, or are you just here to watch the kingdom burn?"* The silver bowl gleams, hungry. The air smells of iron and impending rain.
You: "I'll go after the wagon. My oathbinding can wait. "
DM: Dain’s face darkens like a storm rolling in, but before he can protest, the half-orc guard grabs your forearm, her grip iron. *"Smart or stupid, dwarf, but we’re out of time."* She shoves you toward the chamber’s side door, where Elara disappeared moments ago. *"That wagon’s got Compact colors, but it’s running like it’s got the Night Veil itself on its heels. If you’re chasing it, move!"*

The door slams shut behind you as you burst into a narrow corridor, the air thick with the scent of damp stone and burning oil. Ahead, Elara’s cloak whips around a corner, her boots pounding against the flagstones. She’s not alone—two of her guards flank her, their swords half-drawn, eyes darting like they’re expecting an ambush. *"You’re either brave or a fool,"* Elara snaps over her shoulder, not slowing down. *"That wagon’s not just carrying grain. And whatever’s after it? It’s not human."*

The corridor spills into a courtyard where the wagon in question is already rumbling through the gate, its driver whipping the horses into a frenzy. The back canvas flutters, revealing a glimpse of wooden crates stamped with the Compact’s sigil—except one, smaller and reinforced with iron bands, leaking a faint, sickly green glow. A guard at the gate shouts, *"They’re not stopping for tolls! Archers—!"* But his words cut short as something *screeches* from the shadows beyond the gate, a sound like metal tearing through flesh.

Elara skids to a halt, her face pale. *"By the Octave…"* She turns to you, her voice low and urgent. *"That crate—it’s not ours. It was *planted*. If it gets past the gates—"* She doesn’t finish. She doesn’t need to. The wagon’s wheels spark against the cobblestones as it vanishes into the alleyways, pursued by something unseen but unmistakably *wrong*.

The choice is immediate: chase the wagon into the labyrinth of the city, or demand answers from Elara about what the Compact is *really* transporting. The courtyard guards are drawing weapons, their faces set with grim determination. The air hums with the tension of a storm about to break.
You do: I pursue the wagon.
DM: The cobblestones blur beneath your boots as you sprint after the wagon, the sickly green glow from the iron-banded crate pulsing like a wound. Elara’s guards are already ahead, their cloaks billowing as they weave through the crowd, shoving merchants and laborers aside. *"Move! Compact business!"* one barks, but the panic in his voice betrays him. The wagon careens around a corner, its back canvas flapping wildly—revealing a glimpse of something *writhing* inside the crate, its edges straining against the iron.

You skid into the alley just as the wagon’s rear wheel clips a fruit cart, sending apples and rotten melons flying. The driver doesn’t stop. Behind you, the screeching from the gate grows louder, closer—like a dozen blades scraping bone. A shopkeeper slams his shutters closed, his face ashen. *"Not again,"* he mutters. *"Not in daylight."*

Elara is already mounting a waiting horse, her guards doing the same. She throws a reins at you—*catch*—and her voice cuts through the chaos: *"That crate’s got a Veil-marked relic inside. If it breaches, this whole district becomes a slaughterhouse. You want to help? *Ride!*"* The horse beneath you snorts, sensing your hesitation. The wagon’s lead is growing. The thing in the shadows is gaining.

The alley splits: left toward the docks, where the wagon’s heading, or right into the market square, where the screeching is now accompanied by the sound of splintering wood. The choice is instant—**which path do you take?** The air reeks of ozone and something older, something *hungry*.
You: "Right"
DM: You wrench the horse’s reins to the right, its hooves skidding on the slick cobblestones as you veer into the market square. The air is thick with the stench of burning oil and something *older*—like rust and wet fur. The screeching has become a chorus now, a cacophony of clicking mandibles and hissing breath. Merchants are overturning stalls, scrambling for cover as shadows *move* against the alley walls, too fast, too wrong.

Elara’s guards are already dismounted, forming a ragged line between the encroaching darkness and the square’s center. One of them—a grizzled human with a scar running from his temple to his jaw—shouts, *"It’s in the crates! Don’t let ‘em—!"* His words cut off as a shadow *detaches* from the wall and lunges. His sword flashes, but the thing moves like liquid, wrapping around his arm. The green glow from the wagon’s crate pulses brighter, and the shadow *screams*—a sound that isn’t sound at all, but something that vibrates in your bones.

Elara is at the wagon now, her dagger wedged into the iron-banded crate. *"Moki! Help me pry this open!"* she barks, her voice raw with urgency. The wood beneath her blade is blackened, as if burned from the inside. *"We’ve got to get the relic out before it—!"* A shadow coils around her ankle, and she kicks it off with a snarl, but more are slithering from the alleys, their edges flickering like candle flames.

The choice is now: **help Elara force the crate open** and risk whatever’s inside, or **grab a weapon** and hold the line against the shadows before they overwhelm the square. The horse beneath you rears, its eyes rolling white with terror. The shadows are closing in.
You do: I help elara force the crate open
DM: You lunge for the crate, your fingers finding purchase on the iron bands just as another shadow lashes at your boot. The wood beneath your grip is slick with something oily, the green glow pulsing like a heartbeat. Elara’s dagger is already wedged into the seam, her knuckles white with effort. *"On three!"* she snarls—then the wagon *lurches*, the crate shifting violently as the horse rears. Your footing slips. The dagger skitters free. The crate’s lid flies open with a sound like a dying breath.

Inside, nestled in blackened straw, is a relic: a jagged shard of obsidian the size of your forearm, veined with that same sickly green light. It *throbs*, and the shadows around the square *scream*, recoiling as if burned. Elara stumbles back, her face drained of color. *"Octave’s mercy… that’s not ours. That’s *Night Veil*."* The shard’s glow intensifies, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cobblestones. The air smells of copper and something older—like a tomb cracked open.

The shadows are regrouping, their edges sharpening into blades. The grizzled guard who warned you earlier is down, his sword arm limp, his breath ragged. *"Boss…"* he chokes out, *"it’s calling them—!"* The shard’s pulse quickens. The shadows *twitch*, drawn toward it like moths to a flame.

Elara grabs your shoulder, her voice a whipcrack: *"We’ve got seconds. That thing’s a beacon. Either we destroy it, or we run like hell before every Veil-spawned horror in the city comes crawling."* Her eyes lock onto yours—no more lies, no more games. Just the weight of the choice. The shadows are closing in. The shard *waits*.
You do: I rush towards the shard and hit it with my hammer.
DM: Your hammer crashes down—but the shard *twists* at the last second, as if alive. The obsidian doesn’t shatter. Instead, the impact sends a shockwave through your arms, numbing your fingers. The green light *flares*, and the shadows around the square *shriek*, surging forward like a tide. The shard’s surface is slick, almost *oily*, and your hammer’s head leaves no mark—only a faint, glowing handprint where you touched it.

Elara curses, grabbing your wrist. *"It’s not just a relic—it’s a *trap*!"* The shadows are closer now, their edges sharpening into jagged teeth. The grizzled guard drags himself up, his sword trembling. *"Boss, we ain’t got time for—"* His words cut off as a shadow *lances* through his chest. He crumples, his blood sizzling where the darkness touches it.

The shard pulses again, faster now. The air smells of burning hair and something *older*—like a grave dug up too soon. Elara’s grip tightens. *"Last chance. We either carry this thing to the Compact’s vaults, or we *bury it here*."* The shadows are circling, waiting. The choice is yours.
You: "Fuck! They're probably the only ones who can contain it!"
DM: Elara’s eyes flash with grim recognition as you snarl your realization. *"Damn right,"* she spits, wrenching a tattered Compact sigil from her cloak—a scrap of parchment stamped with the same iron-banded seal as the crate. *"This was supposed to be a *secure* transfer. Someone sold us out."* She shoves the sigil into your hand. *"The vault’s beneath the Granary District. But we’ve got to move—*"*

A shadow *splinters* from the darkness, its edge slicing through the air where Elara’s throat just was. She twists, her dagger flashing, but more are converging, their forms writhing like smoke given teeth. The shard’s glow pulses erratically, casting jagged light across the cobblestones. The remaining guard—his face streaked with blood—shouts, *"They’re not just after *us*! That thing’s *calling* them—!"*

Elara kicks the crate shut with a metallic *clang*, but the damage is done. The shard’s light seeps through the cracks, painting the alley in eerie green. *"No time for subtlety,"* she growls, pressing a compact crossbow into your hands. *"Shoot anything that moves like ink. I’ll get the relic to the vault. *Meet me there*—or don’t, and pray to whatever dwarf gods you’ve got."* She doesn’t wait for an answer. With a curse, she hauls the crate onto her horse and kicks the beast into a gallop, vanishing into the maze of alleys.

The shadows *hiss*, their attention splitting between you and the fleeing relic. The crossbow is heavy in your hands, its bolt tipped with a strange, silvered metal. The choice is immediate: **hold the line** and buy Elara time, or **chase after her**—because something tells you the Compact’s vaults aren’t just for *storing* relics. And if she’s lying? The shadows close in, their hunger palpable. The air reeks of ozone and betrayal.
You do: I chase after her
DM: The crossbow clatters to the cobblestones as you wheel your horse around, kicking it into a gallop after Elara. The shadows shriek, their forms stretching like torn fabric in the wind—some lurching after you, others writhing toward the abandoned shard’s glow. The alley twists, the stench of burning oil and wet fur clinging to your cloak as you lean low over the horse’s neck.

Ahead, Elara’s silhouette weaves through the narrow streets, the crate lashed precariously to her saddle. She doesn’t look back. *"Move, dwarf!"* she snarls over her shoulder, her voice raw. The horse beneath you snorts, its flanks lathered with sweat. The shadows are gaining, their edges skittering along the walls like spiders, but the shard’s glow seems to *repel* them—just barely.

You burst into a wider street, where the scent of salt and grain fills the air: the Granary District. Elara veers sharp left, toward a squat stone building marked with the Compact’s iron-banded sigil. Its doors are already groaning open, two armored figures dragging them wide. One shouts, *"Hurry—!"* before a shadow *slams* into him, sending him crashing into the wall. The other raises a lantern, its light flaring with unnatural intensity. The shadows recoil—but not for long.

Elara skids to a halt, her dagger flashing as she cuts the crate free. It hits the ground with a *thud*, the shard’s glow pulsing like a dying star. She turns to you, her face streaked with soot and blood. *"Help me get this inside, or we’re all dead. *Now!*"* The shadows are massing, their forms coalescing into something larger, something with too many limbs. The choice is instant: **grab the crate** and haul it into the vault, or **cover Elara’s retreat**—because the thing in the darkness is no longer just a shadow. It’s *hungry*.
You do: I grab the crate and haul it into the vault.
DM: Your fingers lock around the crate’s iron bands, muscles straining as you heave it off the ground. The shard’s glow pulses *against* you, its green light flickering like a dying lantern, and for a heartbeat, the shadows *scream*—a sound that isn’t sound, but a pressure in your skull. Your vision swims. The crate is heavier than it should be, as if the shard itself is resisting, but you dig your boots into the cobblestones and *drag* it toward the vault doors.

Elara is already there, her dagger flashing as she cuts down a shadow that lunges from the doorway. *"Hurry, you stubborn rock!"* she snarls, but there’s no mockery in her voice—just raw urgency. The remaining guard is down, his lantern guttering. The shadows are *merging*, their forms twisting into a single, towering mass of jagged darkness.

You take one step. Then another. The crate groans, its wood blackening under your grip. The shard’s glow flares—*burning* your retinas—and suddenly, the weight *shifts*. You stumble, the crate slipping from your hands. It crashes to the ground, the lid flying open. The shard *leaps* upward, hovering in the air like a blade poised to strike. The shadows *howl*, their forms unraveling, drawn toward it—

—and then Elara is there, her gauntleted fist *slamming* a Compact sigil onto the shard’s surface. The green light *implodes*. The shard clatters into the crate, inert. The shadows dissolve into smoke, their screams cutting off mid-wail.

Silence.

Elara exhales sharply, her chest heaving. *"Octave’s bones,"* she mutters, kicking the crate into the vault. The doors groan shut behind it, sealing with a metallic *clang*. She turns to you, her face streaked with soot, her eyes alight with something like respect. *"You’ve got the arms of a siege engine and the sense of a drunk badger. I like that."* She wipes her dagger on her thigh and offers you a hand. *"Come on. The Compact owes you coin, answers, or both. But first—"* She jerks her chin toward the vault’s inner chamber, where the sound of hurried footsteps echoes. *"—we find out who the hell wanted that thing *out* of our hands."* The air smells of scorched metal and old secrets. The choice is clear: **follow Elara into the vault’s depths**, or **demand answers now**—because the Compact’s debts are never simple, and the shadows won’t stay gone for long.
You: "Why the hell didnt you slap that seal on it from the get go?"
DM: Elara barks a laugh, sharp and humorless, as she wrenches the vault door’s locking wheel into place. The metal groans, the sound echoing in the suddenly too-quiet chamber. *"Because, dwarf,"* she says, turning to you with a glare that could strip paint, *"that sigil wasn’t just a *sticker*. It’s a Compact binding—keyed to *this* vault, *this* moment. Slap it on too soon, and the shard would’ve *pulled* every Veil-touched thing within leagues straight to us. We’d have been swimming in shadows before we hit the city gates."*

She yanks off her gloves, revealing fingers wrapped in thin, blackened threads—*burns*, fresh and angry. *"I had to let it *sing* just enough to draw out the hunters. Otherwise, we’d never know who the hell tipped off the Wardens’ League."* Her voice drops, the weight of the unsaid pressing between you. *"Someone in the Compact’s rotten. And that thing?"* She jerks her chin toward the crate, now sealed behind inches of reinforced steel. *"It’s not just a relic. It’s a *key*."*

A distant *clang* echoes from deeper in the vault. Elara’s hand flies to her dagger. *"Speak of the damned,"* she mutters. The air smells of scorched iron and old secrets. *"You want answers? Fine. Let’s go *get* them."* She doesn’t wait for your reply, already striding toward the sound, her boots ringing against the stone. The choice is immediate: **follow her into the vault’s depths**, or **call her out on the risks she’s not mentioning**—because the Compact’s games are never just about coins and crates. And that shard? It’s still *humming*.
You do: I follow her. I want to speak to the Compacts too.
DM: The vault’s inner chamber is a cavern of cold stone and flickering lanterns, their light glinting off rows of iron-bound crates and sealed urns. Elara moves like a blade unsheathed, her dagger still drawn, her gaze locked on the far end of the room where three figures stand around a heavy oak table. Two wear the Compact’s armored tabards, their faces grim. The third—a wiry human with ink-stained fingers—clutches a ledger to his chest like a shield.

*"Ah, Captain Veyne,"* the scribe says, his voice thin as parchment. *"You’ve brought the—"* His eyes dart to you, then the crate, and his Adam’s apple bobs. *"I see. Well. That’s... fortunate."*

Elara doesn’t sheath her dagger. *"Cut the piss-poor welcome, Harkin. Who knew our route?"* The air is thick with the scent of old paper and something sharper—*fear*. The armored guards shift, hands resting on their hilts. One, a broad-shouldered woman with a scarred cheek, meets your gaze for a heartbeat. Her fingers tap a rhythm against her pommel: *danger*.

Harkin swallows. *"The usual channels. The envoy’s manifest was logged, the route filed with the Wardens’ League for safe passage. Protocol, you know that—"*

*"Protocol’s shit when someone’s selling us out,"* Elara snaps. She slams a gauntleted hand onto the table, making the lanterns jump. *"That shard wasn’t just *stolen*. It was *called*. Someone *wanted* those shadows on us. So talk, scribe. Who’s got access to the logs?"*

The scribe’s knuckles whiten around the ledger. *"The League’s adjutant. Our quartermaster. The envoy himself, of course—"* His voice cracks as Elara’s dagger pins the ledger to the table, inches from his fingers.

*"And who *benefits*?"* she growls.

The scarred guard finally speaks, her voice low. *"The grain shortage. The Wardens’ League’s been pushing to control the Border Marches routes. If the Compact loses another shipment..."* She trails off, but the implication hangs heavy: *war*.

Elara’s eyes flick to you, then back to the group. *"Moki here just hauled a Veil-cursed relic through a storm of shadows. That buys her a seat at this table."* She jerks her chin at the ledger. *"Start talking. Who’s dirty?"*

The scribe’s breath hitches. The choice is yours: **press Harkin for names**, **ask the scarred guard about the Wardens’ League’s movements**, or **demand to see the envoy’s manifest**—because the Compact’s secrets are layers deep, and the shard’s hum is still vibrating in your bones.
You do: I stand behind Harkin and press my hand atop his head. "He knows"
DM: The moment your palm slams against Harkin’s skull, pinning his face to the ledger, the chamber *stills*. The scribe’s breath comes in ragged gasps, his ink-stained fingers twitching against the parchment. Elara’s dagger doesn’t waver, but her eyes flick to you—sharp, assessing. The scarred guard’s hand tightens on her hilt, but she doesn’t draw. Not yet.

*"You’re right, dwarf,"* Harkin chokes out, his voice muffled against the table. *"I know. But it’s not what you—"*

A *thud* echoes from the vault’s outer door. The locking wheel spins, uncontrolled. The scarred guard curses, striding toward it, but Elara’s snarl cuts through the tension: *"Talk. *Now*."*

Harkin’s shoulders slump. *"The quartermaster—*Veyla*—she’s been skimming grain tallies for weeks. But she’s not selling to the League. She’s feeding the *Veil*."* His voice drops to a whisper. *"The shadows don’t just hunt the shard. They *worship* it. And she’s their priestess."*

The outer door *groans* open.

Elara’s dagger is at Harkin’s throat in a heartbeat. *"How long?"*

*"Since the last Veil Night,"* he breathes. *"She said the Compact was hoarding too much. That the hungry deserved—"*

A guttural *click* silences him. The lanterns dim. The shard’s crate—*sealed* behind steel—*vibrates*.

The scarred guard staggers back from the door, her face ashen. *"We’re out of time."* Behind her, the darkness *coalesces*.

Elara meets your gaze, her expression unreadable. *"Dwarf. You want answers? *Earn* them."* She shoves Harkin toward you—*your* prisoner, *your* choice—and turns to face the encroaching black. The air reeks of ozone and old blood.

**Hold Harkin as leverage**, **shove him into the shadows as a distraction**, or **bark orders at the guards**—because the Veil doesn’t negotiate, and the shard’s hum is now a *scream*.
You do: I hold Harkin and walk him slowly towards the darkness.
DM: You drag Harkin backward by his collar, your grip iron, his boots scraping against the stone. The darkness ahead *pulses*, hungry, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and something older—*rot*. Harkin whimpers, his ledger slipping from his fingers, pages fluttering like wounded birds.

*"Wait—wait, you don’t understand—!"* he chokes, but his words dissolve into a gag as you tighten your hold. The shadows *lash* forward—

—and then *recoil*.

Not from you. From *him*.

The darkness *hisses*, a sound like steam on hot stone, as the tendrils shrink from Harkin’s ink-stained sleeves. His breath comes in ragged gasps. *"They—they can’t touch me. Not yet. The ledger—it’s *warded*."*

Elara’s curse cuts through the tension. *"Son of a *bitch*."* She strides forward, dagger gleaming, and presses the blade to Harkin’s throat—not to cut, but to *test*. The shadows writhe, but don’t strike. *"He’s marked. Compact ink’s laced with Octave’s salt. The Veil can’t claim him until the debt’s paid."*

The scarred guard snarls, yanking a lantern from the wall. *"Then we *use* that."* She hurls the lantern into the dark. The glass shatters, flame blooming across the floor—and the shadows *scream*, recoiling like burned flesh.

Harkin’s voice is a whisper. *"Veyla said... said the hungry ones would spare me if I fed them *others*."*

The shard’s crate *shudders* behind you.

**Shove Harkin into the flames to buy time**, **demand he swear an oath to the Octave’s salt**, or **use him as bait to lure the shadows toward the guards’ blades**—because the Veil’s patience is thinning, and the Compact’s secrets are burning with it.
You: "What is the debt that needs paying?"
DM: Elara’s dagger doesn’t leave Harkin’s throat, but her gaze flicks to you, sharp as flint. *"The Octave’s salt,"* she mutters, *"isn’t just ink. It’s a *mark*. Every Compact scribe swallows a grain of it when they’re sworn in. Binds ‘em to the ledgers—body and soul. You *lie* in the books, you *pay* in flesh when the Veil comes calling."*

Harkin’s breath hitches. *"Veyla... she said the salt was a *loan*. That the Compact’s been skimming from the Border Marches grain tallies for *years*. The Veil... they don’t just want payment."* His voice cracks. *"They want *interest*."*

The scarred guard spits on the floor. *"So the quartermaster’s been feeding them *people*."*

A guttural *click* echoes from the darkness. The shard’s crate *shudders* again, the metal *groaning* as something *inside* shifts. The shadows at the edges of the lantern light *twist*, forming shapes—*hands*, *faces*—before dissolving into smoke.

Elara’s grip tightens. *"Debt’s due at Veil Night. That’s three days hence."* Her eyes lock onto yours. *"And Harkin here? He’s *overdue*."* The scribe whimpers as the darkness *lunges*—not at him, but past, toward the crate. The humming is a *scream* now.

**Shove Harkin into the shadows to stall them**, **demand he spit the salt out as an offering**, or **order the guards to collapse the vault’s entrance**—because the Veil doesn’t wait, and the shard is *waking up*.
You do: I give harkin to the shadows and urge everyone to exit. We'll lock the vault behind us.
DM: The moment you shove Harkin into the writhing dark, his scream is cut short—not by blades, but by the *snap* of ink-black tendrils coiling around his limbs. His ledger *flares* with eerie blue light as the shadows drag him into the abyss, his final words lost beneath the shard’s deafening *wail*.

Elara doesn’t hesitate. *"Move!"* she barks, grabbing a lantern and hurling it toward the vault’s entrance. The scarred guard slams the iron door shut as you all stumble into the corridor, the locking wheel spinning with a groan. The shard’s scream *muffles*—but doesn’t stop.

Then the vault *explodes*.

Not with fire. With *cold*. Frost creeps across the door as the shadows *seep* beneath it, tendrils snaking into the cracks. The scarred guard curses, pressing her back to the stone. *"That’s not just the Veil. That’s the *Night Veil*. It’s *hungry*."*

Elara’s face is grim. *"We’ve got three days till Veil Night. That shard’s a beacon now—every shadow in the Border Marches is coming for it."* She turns to you, her voice low. *"You just fed the Veil a Compact scribe. That’s either the stupidest thing I’ve seen... or the bravest."* A beat. *"Which was it, dwarf?"*

The corridor trembles. Somewhere below, the shard *pulses*.

**Demand the Compact abandon the vault**, **insist on hunting Veyla before she feeds the Veil more**, or **order the guards to collapse the tunnels**—because the Night Veil doesn’t forget, and the clock is ticking.
You do: insist on hunting Veyla before she feeds the Veil more
DM: The vault door *groans* as frost spreads across its seams, but you’re already moving. "Veyla’s the key," you growl, grabbing Elara’s arm. "She’s the one feeding the Veil. We cut off the source, we starve the shadows before Veil Night."

Elara’s jaw tightens, but her eyes flick to the scarred guard. "*Dara*. How long till the Night Veil breaches that door?"

Dara doesn’t hesitate. "An hour. Maybe less."

Elara curses, then nods. "Fine. But we move *fast*." She turns to the remaining guards, her voice sharp. "You two—collapse the tunnel behind us. Buy us time. The rest? With me." She jerks her chin toward the surface. "Veyla’s got a bolt-hole near the grain silos. If she’s still in the city, that’s where she’ll be."

The corridors blur as you sprint, the air thick with the scent of damp stone and burning lantern oil. The Compact’s stronghold is a maze of tension—guards at every corner, their faces grim. Word’s spread. *The Veil is rising.*

Elara skids to a halt at a junction, pressing herself against the wall. "Silos are ahead. But if Veyla’s there, she won’t be alone." She pulls a vial of black powder from her belt. "One shot at this. We go in hard, we grab her, we *run*."

Dara’s voice is low. "And if she’s already fed the Veil more?"

You meet Elara’s gaze. The choice is clear.

**Kick in the door and rush Veyla**, **set the silos ablaze to flush her out**, or **send a guard ahead as a decoy**—because the Night Veil is coming, and time is a luxury you don’t have.
You do: Kick in the door and rush Veyla
DM: The silo door is flimsy—old wood, warped by years of grain dust and neglect. Your boot connects with a splintering *crack*, the hinges screaming as the door flies inward. Dust swirls in the dim light, revealing sacks of grain stacked haphazardly, their contents spilling like golden rain. And there, at the far end, stands **Veyla**.

She’s not what you expected. No robes, no ritual daggers—just a Compact quartermaster in a stained tunic, her dark hair tied back, a ledger clutched in one hand. But her eyes... they’re wrong. The pupils are *dilated*, swallowing the iris, leaving only a thin ring of hazel around black voids. She smiles, slow and knowing, as the sacks behind her *twitch*.

*"Took you long enough,"* she murmurs.

Then the grain *moves*.

Not spilling. *Crawling*. Shadows slither from the sacks, coalescing into skeletal hands that clutch at the wood. Veyla’s smile widens. *"You’re too late. They’re *hungry*."*

Elara doesn’t hesitate. She hurls her vial of black powder at the grain sacks. *"Fire!"*

Dara’s already striking flint. The spark hits the powder—

—and the silo *erupts*.

Flame roars to life, a wall of heat and light that sends shadows shrieking back into the cracks. Veyla snarls, her ledger flaring with the same eerie blue as Harkin’s. *"You think fire scares them? They *feed* on fear!"* She raises her free hand, and the flames *twist*, forming a tunnel of fire straight toward you.

The heat is suffocating. The choice is instant.

**Dive through the fire tunnel to grab Veyla**, **flank around the flames to cut off her escape**, or **shove a burning sack into the grain to collapse the silo**—because the Night Veil’s hunger is a living thing, and Veyla’s laughter says she’s already won.
You do: Dive through the fire tunnel to grab Veyla
DM: You *plunge* through the fire tunnel, the heat searing your skin, your breath stolen by the smoke. The flames *part* just enough—Veyla’s eyes widen as you crash into her, your momentum sending you both sprawling across the silo floor. The ledger flies from her grip, skidding into the shadows, its blue glow flickering like a dying ember.

Veyla *laughs*, a wet, desperate sound. *"Clever dwarf. But you’re too late."* She twists beneath you, her fingers clawing at your arms—and her skin is *cold*. Unnaturally so. The shadows in the corners of the silo *pulse*, drawn to her touch.

Elara and Dara burst through the fire behind you, but the flames are already dying, the unnatural cold spreading. The grain sacks *shudder*, their contents *writhing* as the Night Veil’s hunger takes hold.

Veyla’s voice drops to a whisper. *"They’re not just in the grain. They’re in the *walls*."* She grins, her teeth blackened at the edges. *"And they’re *hungry*."*

The silo *groans*. The shadows are *moving* now, not just crawling—*rising*. And the ledger’s glow is getting brighter.

**Pin Veyla and demand she call off the Veil**, **grab the ledger and make a run for it**, or **order Elara to collapse the silo now**—because the Night Veil doesn’t bargain, and the walls are *bleeding* shadow.
You do: grab the ledger and make a run for it
DM: Your fingers close around the ledger’s cracked leather—*just* as the shadows *lunge*. The book is *heavy*, unnaturally so, as if the pages are filled with lead. Veyla shrieks, her voice raw, *"You can’t take it! It’s *theirs*!"*

You wrench it free, but the Night Veil doesn’t let go so easily. The shadows *coil* around your arm, icy and suffocating. Your muscles scream as you stumble back, the ledger’s blue glow pulsing like a heartbeat. Elara curses, grabbing your shoulder. *"Move, dwarf!"*

Dara’s already kicking over a lantern. Oil spills across the floor, flames licking at the shadows—but it’s not enough. The walls are *weeping* black tendrils now, the grain sacks *bursting* with writhing darkness. The silo groans, beams splintering as the Night Veil *feeds*.

Veyla’s laughter follows you into the corridor, her voice echoing unnaturally. *"It’s too late! The Compact’s *already* in the ledger! They’ll *all* pay!"*

Elara slams the silo door shut behind you, but the shadows *seep* beneath it, creeping toward your boots. The ledger in your hands *burns*—not with fire, but with the weight of a thousand unpaid debts.

**Toss the ledger to Elara and demand she find a way to destroy it**, **use it as a bargaining chip with the Wardens’ League**, or **rip out the pages with Compact names to break the Veil’s hold**—because the Night Veil doesn’t forget, and the ink is *alive*.
You do: use it as a bargaining chip with the Wardens’ League
DM: The ledger burns in your grip, its blue glow casting jagged shadows across the corridor. Elara’s eyes narrow as you turn to her, voice low and urgent. *"The Wardens’ League will pay *dearly* for this. Veyla’s ledger names every Compact traitor feeding the Veil. We trade it for their help—*now*—or we watch the Border Marches drown in shadow."*

Elara spits, wiping soot from her scarred lip. *"The League? After what they did to the last envoy? They’ll take that book and *gut* us for the trouble."* She jerks her chin toward the silo door. The shadows beneath it are *pulsing*, rhythmic, like a heartbeat. *"That ledger’s a death sentence. You don’t *trade* death sentences. You *bury* them."*

Dara’s voice cuts through the tension, sharp. *"Or you *use* them."* She steps forward, her face grim. *"The League’s got a forward camp at the old mill. If we move fast, we can be there before the Veil spreads. But we’re not just handing over names."* She meets your gaze. *"We demand safe passage for the Compact caravans through the Marches. And a Warden oath—*in blood*—to hunt the Veil with us."*

Elara curses, but the silo groans again, beams splintering. The choice is clear.

**Storm the Wardens’ camp with the ledger as leverage**, **rip out the Compact names to weaken the Veil’s hold first**, or **burn the ledger and let the Wardens and Compact tear each other apart**—because the Night Veil’s hunger is spreading, and the ink is *bleeding* from the pages.
You do: examine the current scene
DM: - **Veyla (Human, Compact Quartermaster)**:
  - *Race/Age*: Pale-skinned human, mid-30s, with hollowed cheeks and fever-bright eyes—pupils swallowed by inky black, veins faintly *glowing* blue at the temples.
  - *Outfit*: Compact quartermaster’s tunic, stained with grain dust and something darker; sleeves rolled to the elbows, revealing *frostbitten* fingers.
  - *Equipment*: A ledger (now in your hands), its pages *pulsing* with blue ink; a broken quill at her belt; no visible weapons, but her *shadow stretches wrong*.
  - *Scars/Marks*: Thin, jagged cuts along her collarbone—*fresh*, like claw marks; lips cracked, teeth blackening at the gums.
  - *Demeanor*: Smiling, *too* relaxed, voice a wet rasp; laughs in *two tones*—hers and something deeper, *beneath*.
  - *Scent/Sounds*: Burnt parchment and iron rust; her breath *hisses* like steam on cold stone; the silo *creaks* in time with her heartbeat.
  - *Environment*: Shadows *pool* under grain sacks, writhing like eels; the ledger’s glow casts *moving* script on the walls—names *bleeding* into the wood.
