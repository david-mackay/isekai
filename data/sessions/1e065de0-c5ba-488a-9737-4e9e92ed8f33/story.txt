DM: The *Sable Gull* cuts through the waves like a blade through silk, her blackened hull groaning as she leans into the wind. You—Kachava—stand on the stormdeck, scales glinting under the pale moonlight, the salt spray stinging your eyes. The crew moves with uneasy purpose: a pair of human sailors coil ropes with too much tension in their shoulders, while a halfling near the mast keeps glancing at the captain’s quarters, her fingers twitching toward the dagger at her belt. The air smells of damp wood, tar, and something sharper—fear, maybe, or the promise of betrayal.

A squall looms on the horizon, its edges jagged with lightning. The ship’s first mate, a grizzled dwarf with a scar running from his temple to his jawline, barks orders to reef the sails. He catches your eye and jerks his chin toward the forecastle. “You’re new blood, but you’ve got the look of someone who’s seen a storm or two. Help batten down, or get below before the Tide takes you.” His voice is rough, but there’s a glint in his eye—testing you, or maybe just desperate for another pair of hands.

As you move to obey, a scrap of parchment flutters near your boot, half-torn and smeared with salt. It’s a fragment of a map, the edges singed as if rescued from a fire. The ink shows a jagged coastline and a single word: *Siren’s Maw*. The halfling’s eyes flick toward it, then away, too quick. The wind howls, and the ship shudders beneath you. The storm is coming, and so is something else.
DM: The moment your claws close around the map fragment, the halfling—*Pippa*, you’ve heard the others call her—darts forward, her dagger suddenly in hand. “That’s not yours, scaly,” she hisses, but her voice wavers. The storm’s first fat raindrops splatter the deck between you, darkening the wood. The dwarf mate’s shout cuts through the wind: *“All hands! Now, or we’re fish food!”*

Pippa’s grip tightens, knuckles white. “Listen,” she mutters, “that map’s got the *Maw* on it. Captain’s been hiding it, but half the crew’s ready to throw him over for it. You hand it over, and I’ll make sure you’re not the one they toss first.” Her breath smells of sour ale and desperation. Behind her, the squall’s roar drowns out the groaning timbers, and the *Sable Gull* lurches as a wave slams her broadside.

The map’s ink bleeds where the rain hits it. *Siren’s Maw*—a name that tastes like a warning. The first mate’s bellowing again, closer now, and the crew’s movements sharpen with panic. Pippa’s blade doesn’t waver, but her eyes do, flicking to the captain’s quarters, where the door hangs slightly ajar. A sliver of lamplight spills out, and for a heartbeat, you see a shadow move inside—too large to be the captain’s.

The storm breaks. The world narrows to the halfling, the map, and the choice: trust her, lie, or act. The wind howls like a thing alive, and the *Gull* shudders again, her rigging screaming. Time’s up.
You: "I would never betray my Captain"
DM: Pippa’s dagger doesn’t lower, but her grip falters for a heartbeat. “You’re either brave or a fool,” she spits, though the wind steals half the words. The *Sable Gull* groans as another wave slams into her, and the lamplight from the captain’s quarters flickers wildly. The shadow inside shifts—too tall, too *wrong*—and for a second, Pippa’s defiance cracks. “Fine. But when the crew turns, and they *will*, don’t come crying to me.”

She shoves the dagger back into her belt and snatches at the map fragment. You let her take it—not out of surrender, but because the storm’s fury demands attention. The first mate’s roar cuts through the chaos: *“Kachava! Get that hatch secured or we’re all swimming!”* His scar stands out stark against his rain-slicked skin, and his glare says this isn’t a request.

Pippa hesitates, then presses the map into your palm with a hiss. “Prove it. Give that to the captain. But if he’s not who you think he is…” She doesn’t finish. The wind does it for her, howling like a warning as the *Gull* shudders again. The captain’s door creaks wider, and the lamplight gutters, revealing a glimpse of a boot—*not* the captain’s—stepping into the shadows. The mutiny isn’t coming. It’s already here.
DM: The *Sable Gull* heaves violently as the storm’s full wrath descends, the deck tilting beneath you like a living thing. Pippa stumbles back, her warning lost to the wind, but the map fragment remains in your grasp—its edges already softening with rain. The captain’s door slams open, revealing not the familiar bulk of Captain Veyla but a towering figure draped in a oilskin cloak, his face obscured by a tattered hood. His gloved hand grips a cutlass, its blade blackened as if scorched.

The first mate’s curse rings out from the stern, but the intruder doesn’t flinch. His voice cuts through the storm, low and grating like rusted iron: *“So the rumors are true. The captain’s got a pet lizard aboard.”* His free hand flicks toward you, and the crew—those not already drawn into the mutiny—freeze, their eyes darting between the blade and the map in your claws.

Pippa’s dagger is back in her hand, but she’s no longer looking at you. Her focus is on the intruder, her breath ragged. *“Dravik,”* she spits. *“You said we’d wait until after the storm.”*

Dravik’s laugh is a dry, humorless thing. *“Plans change, halfling. The *Maw* don’t wait for cowards.”* His cutlass shifts, its tip now aimed at the map. *“Hand it over, dragonkin. Or I’ll carve the truth out of your scales.”*

The *Gull* groans again, her timbers screaming as a wave crashes over the bow. The first mate is down, blood mixing with rainwater on the deck. The storm has given Dravik his opening, and the mutiny is no longer brewing—it’s here, steel-bright and hungry. The choice is yours: fight, flee, or gamble on words. But the ship won’t hold forever.
You: "If we do this now we'll all die in the storm"
DM: The wind tears the words from your maw, but Dravik hears them—or perhaps he simply sees the truth in the *Gull*’s desperate lurch. The ship groans as another wave slams into her, the mast creaking like a dying beast. Pippa’s dagger trembles in her grip, her knuckles white, but Dravik’s cutlass doesn’t waver. His hood slips just enough to reveal a jagged scar running from his temple to his cheek, pale against the storm-darkened skin. *“Coward’s logic,”* he snarls, but there’s a flicker of hesitation in his stance. The *Gull* isn’t just fighting the storm; she’s fighting *him*.

Pippa seizes the moment, her voice sharp as a blade. *“He’s right! We’re all dead if we don’t get this ship under control! Dravik, you want the *Maw*? Then *help us survive* to reach it!”* She shoves past him, grabbing a coil of rope and tossing it to a nearby sailor. *“Reef the mainsail, you bilge rats, or we’re feeding the Tide!”*

Dravik’s gaze locks onto you, the map fragment still clutched in your claws. The storm rages between you, rain lashing like whips, but the tension is thicker than the salt in the air. *“Fine. But this isn’t over, dragonkin,”* he growls, sheathing his cutlass with a deliberate slowness. *“When the storm breaks, that map better find its way to me. Or you’ll learn why they call me *Dravik the Flayer*.”* He turns, barking orders to the crew, but his eyes linger on you—a promise, or a threat.

The *Sable Gull* shudders again, her timbers screaming. The first mate is down, blood pooling around him, and the storm shows no mercy. The choice is still yours: help the crew, tend to the wounded, or make a move while Dravik’s back is turned. But the ship won’t wait. Neither will the mutineers.
You do: I grab the first mate and bring him to the Med Bay
DM: The storm’s fury howls around you as you drop to one knee beside the first mate. His breath is shallow, his scarred face pale beneath the rain, but his eyes flicker open as you haul him up. *“Leave me, you fool,”* he rasps, blood bubbling at his lips. *“The *Gull* needs—”* A cough wracks him, spraying crimson onto the slick deck. The ship lurches again, and you tighten your grip, scales digging into his leather jerkin as you drag him toward the companionway.

The med bay is a cramped, lantern-lit den beneath the forecastle, reeking of herbs and salt. The ship’s surgeon—a wiry gnome with ink-stained fingers—whirls as you kick the door open. *“By the Tide’s teeth, another?”* she snaps, but her hands are already moving, snatching a wad of bandages from a shelf. The first mate groans as you lay him on the bloodstained table, his breath hitching. *“Dravik… mutiny…”* he manages, his voice a gravelly whisper.

The surgeon’s fingers probe the wound—a deep gash across his ribs, dark with blood. *“Aye, and the storm’s doing his work for him,”* she mutters, pressing a wad of cloth to the wound. *“Hold this, or he’s done.”* Her eyes flick to you, sharp with assessment. *“You’ve got the look of someone who’s patched a wound or two. You want him to live? Then *help*.”* She shoves a needle and gut string into your claws, her voice dropping to a hiss. *“And if you’re smart, you’ll tell me why a dragonborn’s playing nurse while the ship’s tearing itself apart.”*

Outside, the *Gull* screams, her timbers straining. The mutineers are still above, the storm still raging, and the map fragment burns in your pocket like a secret. The first mate’s life is in your hands—literally. The surgeon’s waiting. The ship won’t hold forever.
You: "I saw that he was hurt and wanted to help. I'll handle Dravik when the time comes. "
DM: The surgeon’s hands still for a heartbeat as you speak, her sharp eyes flicking from the first mate’s wound to your face. *“Well, aren’t you a rare one,”* she mutters, but there’s no softness in her voice—just the weight of someone who’s seen too many choose otherwise. The first mate’s breath hitches as she tightens the stitch, her ink-stained fingers working with brutal efficiency. *“Dravik’s not the type to wait for ‘when the time comes,’ dragonkin. He’s the type to *make* the time.”* She jerks her chin toward the porthole, where the storm’s fury muffles the distant shouts of the crew. *“But if you’re set on playing hero, you’d best finish this quick. That mutiny won’t stay topside forever.”*

The first mate’s eyelids flutter. *“Kachava…?”* His voice is a rasp, but his gaze sharpens as it locks onto yours. *“The captain… not what he seems. The *Maw*—”* A cough wracks him, spraying fresh blood onto the table. The surgeon curses, pressing a wad of cloth to his lips. *“Save your strength, you old barnacle,”* she snaps, but her hands don’t slow.

Outside, the *Gull* shudders again, her timbers groaning like a living thing. The first mate’s fingers twitch, grasping at your forearm. His grip is weak, but his words cut through the storm’s roar: *“The map… it’s a lie. The *Maw* isn’t a place. It’s a—”* His body convulses, another cough tearing through him. The surgeon shoves you aside, her voice a whipcrack. *“Enough! Either help or get out! He’s not dying on my table because you’ve got a death wish!”*

The choice is yours: stay and fight for his life, or take his warning and act before Dravik’s patience runs out. The storm won’t wait. Neither will the mutineers.
You do: I'll fight for Dain's life. 
DM: The first mate—*Dain*—gasps as you press your claws against the wound, staunching the bleeding while the surgeon threads the needle. His skin is slick with sweat and salt, his breath shallow, but his eyes lock onto yours with a fierceness that cuts through the pain. *“Dragonkin’s got hands like a surgeon’s,”* the gnome mutters, her voice grudging but approving. *“Hold him steady—this’ll hurt.”*

Dain’s body tenses as the needle bites into his flesh, but he doesn’t cry out. Instead, his fingers dig into your forearm, his voice a ragged whisper. *“The *Maw*… it’s not a place. It’s a *ship*. A ghost ship, cursed to sail the Shoals. The captain—”* His words dissolve into a choked groan as the surgeon yanks the thread tight. *“He’s not hunting it. He’s *running* from it.”* Blood flecks his lips, but his gaze burns with urgency. *“Dravik’s a fool. He thinks the map leads to treasure, but it’s a trap. The *Maw* doesn’t take gold. It takes *souls*.”*

The *Gull* shudders again, her timbers screaming. Above deck, the storm’s howl is punctuated by the clash of steel—Dravik’s mutiny is in full swing. The surgeon’s hands falter for half a second, her ears twitching. *“They’re fighting up there,”* she hisses. *“If Dravik wins, we’re all dead. If the storm wins, we’re *still* dead.”* She ties off the stitch and shoves a roll of bandages into your claws. *“Wrap him tight. I’ve got to see to the others.”*

Dain’s grip weakens, but his voice is iron. *“Kachava… listen. The captain’s cabin—there’s a chest. Black iron, locked with a silver key. Inside…”* His eyes roll back, his body going limp. The surgeon curses, slapping his cheek. *“Stay with me, you stubborn old salt!”* But Dain’s out, his breathing shallow but steady.

The choice is yours: stay and guard him, search the captain’s cabin for the chest, or rush on deck to turn the tide of the mutiny. The storm rages. The *Gull* won’t hold forever. And Dravik’s patience is running out.
You do: I go to the deck and confront Dravik. 
DM: The companionway ladder is slick with rain as you kick open the hatch, the storm’s howl swallowing your emergence onto the deck. The *Gull* bucks like a wounded beast, her sails torn, her rigging groaning. Dravik stands at the helm, his cutlass flashing as he barks orders to a cluster of mutineers. Pippa is cornered near the mainmast, her dagger drawn but her stance faltering—until she sees you. Her eyes widen, a flicker of relief or warning, but there’s no time.

Dravik whirls at your approach, his scarred face twisting into a snarl. *“Dragonkin,”* he spits, *“I should’ve known you’d slither back up.”* The wind tears at his cloak, revealing the glint of a pistol tucked into his belt. The crew—what’s left of them—pause, their weapons half-raised, their loyalty split like the *Gull*’s timbers. *“You’ve got one chance,”* Dravik growls, stepping forward. *“Hand over the map, or I’ll feed your scales to the Tide.”*

The ship lurches violently, a wave crashing over the starboard rail. Pippa seizes the moment, her voice cutting through the storm. *“Dravik, you fool! The *Maw* isn’t treasure—it’s a *death trap*! The captain knew! That’s why he—”* A mutineer’s fist silences her, sending her crashing to the deck. Dravik’s gaze flicks to her, then back to you, his patience fraying. *“Last warning, dragonkin. The map. *Now*.”*

The crew watches, their grips tightening on weapons. The storm rages. The *Gull* won’t hold forever. And Dravik’s hand hovers over his pistol. What do you do?
You do: I give him the map
DM: The map fragment burns in your claws as you step forward, the storm’s fury whipping your scales. Dravik’s pistol is halfway drawn, his mutineers tensed like coiled serpents—but your voice cuts through the wind. *“Here.”* You toss the map at his feet, the parchment unfurling against the blood-slicked deck.

Dravik’s snarl falters. He stares at the map, then at you, suspicion warring with triumph. *“About damn time,”* he growls, but his grip on the pistol loosens. The crew murmurs, their weapons lowering—until Pippa’s voice rings out, raw with desperation. *“It’s a trap, you idiot! The *Maw* isn’t treasure—it’s a *ghost ship*! The captain knew! That’s why he—”* A mutineer’s boot silences her with a kick, but the damage is done.

Dravik’s eyes flick to the map, then to the horizon, where the storm’s maw parts just enough to reveal a shape in the distance: a vessel, black as pitch, its sails tattered, its hull *wrong*—like it’s sailing *through* the waves, not on them. The *Gull* groans, her timbers shuddering as if in terror. Dravik pales, his bravado crumbling. *“By the Tide…”* he breathes.

The crew sees it now. The mutineers falter. The storm howls, and the *Maw* draws nearer, her presence a weight on the soul. Dravik’s voice is a rasp. *“Dragonkin… you knew?”* His hand hovers over the pistol again, but his aim is uncertain. The *Gull* won’t outrun this. The *Maw* won’t be bargained with.

The choice is yours: fight, flee, or confront the truth of the *Maw*—before it claims them all.
You: "I just found out too. Maybe next time you should actually have some faith in your fucking captain. They're probably the only one who can get us out of this now. "
DM: The deck falls silent. Even the storm seems to hush, as if the wind itself is holding its breath. Dravik’s face twists—shame, fury, or fear, you can’t tell—but his pistol hand drops. The crew shifts, their weapons lowering. Pippa pushes herself up from the deck, her dagger still clutched in her hand, her knuckles white. *“Faith?”* she spits, but her voice wavers. *“The captain’s been lying to us since we left port! That thing—”* She points at the *Maw*, its jagged silhouette cutting through the storm like a blade. *“—isn’t just *out there*. It’s been *following* us.”*

Dravik’s jaw tightens. He glances at the *Maw*, then at you, his pride warring with something darker. *“Fine,”* he growls, but the word is heavy, like an anchor dropped. *“But if we’re trusting the captain, we’d best find him. *Now*.”* He turns to the crew, his voice rough with command. *“You lot—get this tub moving! Rig for speed, not fight. We’re not outrunning that thing, but maybe we can outmaneuver it.”* The mutineers hesitate, then move, their loyalty fractured but their fear of the *Maw* stronger.

The *Gull* groans as she turns, her timbers protesting. The *Maw* looms closer, its presence a weight in your chest, like the air before a storm breaks. Pippa steps toward you, her voice low. *“You really think the captain can fix this?”* There’s no mockery in her tone, just desperation. *“Because if he can’t, we’re all dead.”*

The companionway yawns open behind you, the stairs leading below deck. The captain’s cabin is there. The truth is there. And the *Maw* is coming. What do you do?
You: "At the very least he should know more about what's going to happen. Let's ask him about what's in his chest.  "
DM: The storm’s fury feels distant as you turn toward the companionway, Pippa and Dravik’s arguments fading behind you. The *Gull* groans, her timbers protesting as she cuts through the waves, but the *Maw* looms closer, its presence a chill in your bones. The crew is scattered—some manning the rigging, others staring at the ghost ship with wide, terrified eyes. No one stops you as you descend below deck.

The captain’s cabin is dim, the only light filtering through the cracked porthole, casting jagged shadows across the floor. The air smells of salt, old parchment, and something sharper—gunpowder, maybe, or fear. The black iron chest sits beneath the captain’s desk, its surface etched with strange, swirling patterns that seem to writhe in the low light. The silver key glints in its lock, untouched.

You hear the captain before you see him. His voice is a low growl, rough with command and something darker. *“Took you long enough, Kachava.”* He steps from the shadows near the stern windows, his coat damp, his face lined with exhaustion. His eyes flick to the chest, then back to you. *“Dain talked, didn’t he?”* He doesn’t wait for an answer. *“Of course he did. That old salt never could keep a secret when the Tide was calling.”* He exhales sharply, running a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. *“The chest holds what’s left of my crew from the last time I met the *Maw*. Their names. Their things. Their *fates*.”* His voice drops, almost a whisper. *“And the one thing that might save us now.”*

He steps closer, his boots thudding against the wooden floor. *“You want to know what’s in it? Fine. But you’re not going to like it.”* His hand hovers over the chest’s lid, then stills. *“The *Maw* doesn’t just take souls. It *offers* things in return. Power. Knowledge. A way out.”* His jaw tightens. *“I took its bargain once. That’s how I got this ship. That’s how I got this *crew*. And that’s how I know we’re not running from it.”* He meets your gaze, his eyes dark with something like regret. *“We’re being *herded*.”*

Above deck, the *Gull* shudders as another wave crashes against her hull. The captain’s voice cuts through the storm’s roar. *“So. You going to help me, or are you going to stand there until the *Maw* decides to collect you too?”* His hand finally rests on the chest’s lid. *“Because if we’re doing this, we’d best do it *now*.”*
