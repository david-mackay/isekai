DM: The air reeks of iron and damp earth as your boots sink into the mud of a trampled wheat field. Dawn hasn’t broken yet, but the horizon glows like a smoldering coal, casting long shadows across the furrows. Ahead, the silhouettes of three figures crouch behind an overturned cart, their breath ragged. One clutches a bloodied arm, another curses under their breath as they try to string a bow. The third—a woman with a sergeant’s braided cuff—turns her head just enough to lock eyes with you. *"About time,"* she hisses, *"or did you just come to watch us die?"*

A guttural roar splits the air. From the tree line, something massive shifts, branches snapping like kindling. The beast isn’t just a rumor. It’s here. And it’s hungry.

The sergeant doesn’t wait for your answer. She shoves a dagger hilt-first toward you. *"Left flank’s wide open. Either help or get gone—but do it *now*."* The bowman looses an arrow; it thunks into the darkness, answered by a snarl that vibrates in your ribs. The wounded one whimpers, *"By the Octave, it’s circling—"*

The choice is yours. The cart offers cover, the high ground of a broken fence lies to your right, and the beast’s snarls suggest it’s favoring the left. What do you do?
